“THE ROOT OF WISDOM IS TO FEAR THE LORD, AND THE BRANCHES THEREOF ARE LONG LIFE.” ECCLESIASTICUS 1:20

(inscribed above the throne in the Chapel of the Company Anchorite)

*Go quietly.*

*The Haustorium is not quite so kind as Hush House, but the foolish do not become librarians.*

Welcome, early readers. Give exploration a try, beginning with the [[apachita]] that guides the Know to the Haustorium.
