# Guestroom: Paternal
Leonor left this suite open for her lover, whom she hoped to someday bring up the mountainside to join her. Instead, it was Alfonso de Soraluce who brought her lover here, yet denied them the opportunity to be together. For decades afterwards though, the Curicuillorians and Bahamonde would laugh reminiscing at the way the conquistador would make a great show of retiring to his princely quarters at the end of each day, then sneak out around midnight to plead desperately at Leonor's door to let him in. Eventually, de Soraluce's desperation fell away to cruelty, and wedding arrangements were made with drawn steel. 
## Nocturnal Hunger (Locked)
Beams of darkness crash through the windows and scurry like rats. They have gnawed away at the rich fabrics and left them a somber sable.
