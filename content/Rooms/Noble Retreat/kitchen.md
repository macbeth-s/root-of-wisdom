# Kitchen
This is a modern range, straight from the finest establishments in Noon. It was a gift to Robigo and Shura from the generous members of the Ordo Limiae. 'Apparently,' one Obliviate complained upon being ordered to brave the Andean winter with kitchen appliances in tow, 'the Ivory Chain does not forbid us from courting the hospitality of Nowhere.'
## Deep-Stained Kitchen (Locked)
Shura prepared her meals here at some point, if the viscera and outlines of flesh are any indication. Cleaning these requires more primal techniques.
**Essential:** Assistance
**Required:** 11 Grail, 11 Moth
