# Terrace Garden
The same agricultural practices developed by the engineers of the Fourfold Realm are in use here. In the days of the Colegio de Santa Potenciana, its yields were never enough to actually sustain the members of the Company Anchorite who dwelt here, but all rectors generally agreed on the virtue of farming as a holy practice. This did not mean they worked the earth themselves, however. For over sixty years, much of that task was left to an Aymara man named Alejo Sisa who made the trek up the mountainside daily rather than take up residence alongside the Company. He seems to have known what he was doing, as mighty ward-stones laid under the soil have stopped most fungal infestations from destroying the garden.
## Dormant Terraces(Locked)
Flattened plants litter the terraces. Without a nurturing hand, they surrendered to the mountain.
