# Vigilkeeper's Coatroom  
When the Haustorium was known as the Ruin of the Roots, in the high days of the Realm of Four Parts, it was the destination of many a formidable adventurer and mountaineer. Upon arrival, it was traditional to descend into the tunnels beneath the ruin and partake of fungi in order to see higher.  
## Fascinating Shadows (Locked)  
Glittering shadows wander aimlessly. I feel myself drawn to fall into them. With careful direction, they will escort themselves out of the Haustorium entirely.  
**Essential:** Assistance  
**Required:** 7 Sky, 7 Rose
