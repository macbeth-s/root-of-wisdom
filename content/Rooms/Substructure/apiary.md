# Apiary  
Berenechea Bee-eater was a fixture of the Haustorium during its ignominious Mutuality Era, following the explusion of the Company Anchorite. He was said to dwell in, and decorate, the Substructure with various ephemera he thought the Mutuality should consider in the course of their bewilderingly active scholarship. He also kept Amazonian milepona bees despite the harsh climate of the mountains.  
## Sickening Sweetness (Locked)  
The saccharine scent of rose or honey or caramel disorients the bees. If I stir them out of their state, they can rein in the odor.  
<br>**Essential:** Assistance
