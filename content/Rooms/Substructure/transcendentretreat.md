# Transcendent Retreat  
Light a candle; see the roots weave the world around you; follow history to the source.  
## Shimmering Sanctuary (Locked)  
This is a sacred place for some, a threshold, a frontier... revelatory ergot infest the scattered vessels, and a mere breath is enough to see lights flicker once again in the long-extinguished candles.
