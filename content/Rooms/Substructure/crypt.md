# Crypt  
The world over, human sacrifice has accompanied knowledge of the Hours. Blood was spilt here over two thousand years ago, and the roots still remember to drink of it. It is difficult to discern who this blood was for, but tradition holds that the sacrifices entered the Mansus through the consumption of a particular sacrament before they were offered up. Do we bleed in dreams?  
## Parched Crypt (Locked)  
This room is dry and frigid, so little has decayed in the centuries since breath last warmed the space. I will need warmth enough to breathe, and light enough to see, but not so much it degrades the precious contents  
**Essential:** Assistance  
**Required**: 9 Forge, 9 Lantern
