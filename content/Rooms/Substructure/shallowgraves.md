# Shallow Graves  
Some of the Company Anchorite's detractors have long claimed that one of the order's many goals has always been to create and disinter relics of their own. This reputation was exacerbated when the Company, increasingly desperate for cash and cachet, allowed the infamous huaquera Gabriela Ber to poke around their Colegio.  
## Exhumed Graveyard (Locked)  
Emptied graves ache to be filled. Old bones or fresh libations can abate their cravings.  
**Essential:** Assistance  
**Required:** 8 Winter, 8 Grail
