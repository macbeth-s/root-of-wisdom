# Mycological Laboratory  
Father Xavier Saavedra, CA, the last rector of the Colegio de Santa Potenciana, was an amateur naturalist and enthusiastic student of fungi. Due to opposition from his brothers, he primarily studied in the substructure. The laboratory was updated and renovated by Louize Haig on her second visit to the Haustorium.  
## Mold-warped Laboratory (Locked)  
Black mold crawls out of every corner, plaster swollen from its presence. Scientific notes and instruments are occluded by the dark growth. The damage can be mended, but we must not let a single spore remain.  
**Essential:** Assistance  
**Required: **8 Moth, 8 Forge
