# Chapel of the Company Anchorite  
After the brief and bloody melee that followed Curicuillor and de Soraluce's deaths, when Bahamonde made peace with Curicuillorians and conquistadors alike, the humble friar quickly summoned the brothers of his order to the retreat of the Fourfold princes. Here, some say, the Covenant-stone of the Colegio was first exalted. All but the Curicuillorians ate of the host that day, and there the library was born.  
## Hollow Chapel (Locked)  
This is a place of significance for the Haustorium, but not a holy one. Whatever powers were worshipped here have withdrawn, but with the right words and precise harmonies, we can bring back their favor.  
**Essential:** Assistance  
**Required:** 14 Knock, 14 Moon, 14 Sky
