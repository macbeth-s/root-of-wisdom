# Reliquary  
In the religious fervor of the early 16th century, a group of seven men met on the bank of the Guadalquivir, near the shrine of Saint Potenciana. That night, they made vows to each other in blood and knocked down the walls of Saint Potenciana's cloister, stealing what relics they found within and rebuilding the wall behind them. These seven men then parted ways to seek out seven women, pledging to reunite someday in the New World, where many more relics were being created each day under the conquistador's heel.
