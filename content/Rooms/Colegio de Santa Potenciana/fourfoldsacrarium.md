# Fourfold Sacrarium  
Leonor was a princess, and as such brought many riches from her father's palace to her retreat in the mountains. She was prescient to do so; much of the Fourfold Realm's treasures were sacrified at the altar of the Universal Monarchs within years of her flight. Martina la Maga preserved these items throughout Bahamonde's rectorship, but much knowledge of their true power died with her.  
## Sacred Magics (Locked)  
A mighty Adept guarded this place with all of their strength and passion. I must assure these wards that I respect their history, or shatter them with merciless wrath.
