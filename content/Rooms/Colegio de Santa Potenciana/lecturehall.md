# Lecture Hall  
Dahlmann still lectures here to an audience of no-one. This keeps with the tradition of friars of the Company Anchorite expounding on their heterodox creeds to initiates, though Dahlmann often laments the knowledge that could have been learned had the Company Anchorite allowed the Curicuillorians to teach.  
## Dry Lessons (Locked)  
Someone is speaking. Another member of the faculty seems to be midway through a lecture. There is passion behind the teaching, despite the dryness of the voice. Maybe I could slip in the back, quietly, and learn.
