# Anchorite Cloister  
Despite the order's intense secrecy, extensive documentation from the Inquisition has shown that the Company Anchorite has directly financed, supported, and controlled several hundred anchorites and anchoresses since the sixteenth century. Many were cloistered here. It is well-known that an anchoress was present when the Haustorical Mutuality emerged, but her name has been lost to history. The cell has been vacant, but also unopened, since.  
## Pentimento (Locked)  
An unintended trace is lodged in the world's skin. The wound will rot and let Nowhere-energies (or worse) leak through, so I must seal it with the strongest colors of the Hours.
