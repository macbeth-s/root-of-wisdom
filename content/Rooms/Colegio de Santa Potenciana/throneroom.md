# Throne Room  
The Sapan Inka had a vision for who would sit on this throne. Leonor Curicuillor desired another, while Alfonso de Soraluce wanted to sit on it himself. Now, all kneel at the foot of the one who has been Crowned, and all are grateful that this rule will be softer than any others.  
## Homage (Locked)  
Even Robigo kneels here, before the throne of his liege lord. His court is closed, but if the eldest of the coterie petition for me, I may be received into their number.
