# Rector's Study  
The rectorship was always a challenging position, beset by opposition on all sides. The Viceroy begrudgingly recognized the Company's right, but political and economic pressure grew through the seventeenth century. Bahamonde and his successors struggled every day to preserve the order's secrets, maintain a fragile peace with the Curicuillorians, ward off Obliviates and Inquisitors, and fight back the rot. Ultimately, they all failed and the Company Anchorite is no more.  
## Deo Volente (Locked)  
All rectors, not just Orgóñez, were well-versed in the ways of opening and prohibiting passage. It will take some divine favor and great skill to prove myself worthy to sit where they sit.  
**Essential:** Skill  
**Required:** 6 Knock, 6 Winter, 6 Forge
