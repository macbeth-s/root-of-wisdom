# Dormitory  
The last confirmed friar of the Company Anchorite, Friar Guillermo Alcaraz, died in his sleep here in 1817. He had been rotting from within for decades, but had clung to life and received several visitors. His last words are reported to have been inquiring after the anchoress for whom he was responsible.  
## Wounded Dormitory (Locked)  
The open windows and crumbling masonry have let wind and precipitation throw this room into damp disarray. It'll be a struggle to get it back into order, but we must seal up these holes.  
**Essential:** Assistance  
**Required:** 13 Forge, 13 Heart, 13 Winter
