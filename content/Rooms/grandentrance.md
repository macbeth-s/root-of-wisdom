# Grand Entrance
The art in this room is tasteful, and the provenances of the works are immensely varied. It is only on closer scrutiny that one would begin to feel fear. Just recently, a tapestry belonging to Friar Silas Menard, an old rector of the Colegio, was stolen from this room, underneath the Protector's very nose. The consequences of this theft are still being felt internationally, but the effect on the collection's cohesiveness is unmistakable.
## Protected Gallery (Locked)
Someone is here. Someone guards the Gallery... someone guards the entire Haustorium. He is the Protector, the Generous of Hosts, a Name of things beyond my comprehension. I must speak well, I must not be rude. Perhaps someone can go ahead to introduce me.
