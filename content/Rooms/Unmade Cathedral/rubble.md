# Rubble
It is a common misconception that some South American ruins became ruins because of the Conquest. While it's true that many a wonder of the bright and Hidden Worlds were destroyed by the legions of the Universal Monarchs, the Haustorium was already called a ruin in 1300, when adventurous Wayfinders came here for spiritual retreat. Whoever first laid the stones of the oldest wing did so over two thousand years ago. The specific stones of this pile of rubble, however, were hastily assembled by the Company Anchorite in the eighteenth century and fell apart easily at the 1840 earthquake.
