# Taxidermy Exhibit
For two centuries, the peace between Bahamonde and the native adepts who had found refuge at the Haustorium held with only occasional disruption. By the Company Anchorite's suspicious design, however, the Curicuillorians dwindled in number until the mid-eighteenth century, when Almudena Shu単a stood alone as a non-Catholic Adept at the Colegio. Her relationship with Father Saavedra was rocky until they discovered a shared love of journeying to the tropical forests where Saavedra could collect samples and Shu単a could hunt to her heart's content. Many of Shu単a's prizes have been preserved and displayed here.

None of the displays are still alive, their furred and scaled bodies inert. But I cannot bring myself to meet their hungry, hateful gaze - not until I can appease them.
