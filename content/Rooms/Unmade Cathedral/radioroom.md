# Radio Room
As war brewed across each ocean, Doctor Haig brought and installed all this sophisticated equipment, hoping to curry favor once again with the existing faculty and perhaps secure her own installation at the Haustorium. The faculty seem to have accepted her donation, but turned her away for a fifth time. From this room, one can observe the passage of warships and flightpaths of bombers, and communicate with fellow travelers the world over. 
## Ouranic Airs (Locked)
The room gives way to the deep-blue haze of the Upper Heavens, where faint birdsong drifts from. If I can push past its walls, this half-dream will end.
