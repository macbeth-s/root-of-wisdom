# Fossil Display
This fossil was a donation (some might say a payment) by the Patriarch of the Bithynian Church of the Chiliasm to the Haustorical Mutuality, in exchange for their suppression of a particular publication. It has proved remarkably useful for many skolekosophists over the years, but  shavings of bones and small fangs have increasingly been going missing in recent decades. 
## Skeletal Forbiddance (Locked)
A shifting mass of bones bars me from entering. Is it a guardian spirit? A territorial nuisance? Either way, an accurate application of force can get me through.
