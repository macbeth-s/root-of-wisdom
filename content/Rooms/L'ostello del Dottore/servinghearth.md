# Serving-Hearth
Despite his emphasis on hospitality, Robigo himself has never been known to cook. Berenechea Bee-Eater once prepared a sensational meal here after the earthquake, but he vanishes from the record soon afterwards. The hearth is ancient and carved to resemble the rocky nest of the Andean condor. In 1680, Beatriz Huaylas poisoned the rector of the Colegio and two of his guests. This was a long time coming: as part of their pact with the Company, the Curicuillorians insisted on 'exclusive rights and final say over consumption and production in this ruin.'
## Dimmed Hearth (Locked)
No flame alit, no edible food within. Some artistry might breathe live back into the hearth, some effort may clean and sanitize the pailas strewn in the back corner.
