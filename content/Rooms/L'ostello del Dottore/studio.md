# Studio
Libreng Ibon was thrice offered a faculty position at the Haustorium, and thrice refused. He did, however, spend many a clear day watching the mountains, and softly, subtly, enquiring Robigo about the nature of 'precious stones, cast down' while sketching on blank parchment. Robigo, confused by the halting riddle-speak of the questions, threw many artifacts out the window: a sacrificial knife, a chunk of amber, a sapphire necklace salvaged from the Sanguineto. Ibon concluded that Robigo was not mad, merely stupid, and made his leave.
