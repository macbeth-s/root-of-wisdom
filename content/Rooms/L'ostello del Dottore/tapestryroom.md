# Tapestry Room
There is a person spoken of by faculty of the Haustorium whose identity exists only in the camelid-fur art she left behind. The Curicuillorians called her 'Weaver,' the Anchorites did not speak of her at all, and the Mutuality called her by a Killasimi name that could not be uttered, but could be touched. When Delilah Molotla dated the Weaver's tapestries to the first centuries AD, despite their depiction of scenes from far later, a flurry of academic interest followed. Eager to capitalize on the Haustorium's newest celebrity, Robigo had this room furnished to attract long-term guests. He attracted little but thieves.
## Woven Wards(Locked)
Robigo set (or grew) these voracious traps after the 1936 theft. I cannot enter safely unless I prove myself as a friend or one of his hosted.
