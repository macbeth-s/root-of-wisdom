# Discourteous Room
Robigo wants the Haustorium to have a faculty; to salvage from the horrifying pallor of the Mutuality a reputation for achievement and brilliance. Yet Robigo also serves powers that are not to be trifled with, and he himself loathes discourtesy. In 1851 the mighty forge-long Kume Tsūten was involved with Nacéra Bengui in an explosive dispute over the Worm Museum. When in the course of their disagreement Kume singed the upholstery on one of Robigo's favorite chaises, newly imported from Italy, Robigo insisted he move Kume from his glasswork in the cathedral and into this guest room. Kume never re-emerged, despite his Longhood.
