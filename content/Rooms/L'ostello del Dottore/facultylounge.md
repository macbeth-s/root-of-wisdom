# Faculty Lounge
When Dottore Robigo so orders, the faculty of the Haustorium gather here to nervously sip drinks and smile blandly at the Protector's long-winded anecdotes. Such a summons has not been given in decades, much to the relief of the handful of scholars who care for their respective wings of the library.
## Inhospitable Lounge (Locked)
I don't belong here. (At least, not yet.) This is the gathering place for the group of Adepts and Long and Know who have been named faculty, but on occasion servants and staff have been permitted to take notes, or refill drinks. <br>
**Essential:** Assistance<br>
**Required:** 5 Lantern, 5 Moon, 5 Scale, 5 Knock<br>
