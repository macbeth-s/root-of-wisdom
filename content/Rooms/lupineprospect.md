# Lupine Prospect
The 1840 Earthquake split this plaza in two, which led to its brutal dedication to the Wolf-Divided by Sister Oxiacantha. As part of the dedication, blood was spilt then carefully gathered and sealed, so that it might never return to the earth. 
## Contemnant Offering (Locked)
Jagged gray shapes prowl across the flatstones. Wolf-splinters. I cannot chase them away, but if I share in their agony, it can keep me from their maws.
<br>**Essential:** Malady
<br>**Required:** 1 Edge, 1 Winter
