# Vestibule
The threshold's first inscription cannot be dated, even by the most expert of archaeologists. It is written in Vak, the door-script that confounds even the most sophisticated adepts. Each later inscription can be identified with a particular era of the Haustorium's history: Quechua to the sixteenth century when the noblewoman Leonor Curicuillor and her entourage resided here, Latin to the heterodox order who founded an occult college here, Killasimi to the enigmatic Haustorical Mutuality, and Spanish to the relatively recent re-opening of the Library following the earthquake.
## A True Threshold (Locked)
I have reached the threshold of the Haustorium. Across the door, inscribed in Quechua, Latin, Spanish, and two occult scripts: 'HISTORY IS THE ROOT OF THE WORLD.' The doors are so heavy I will need help to open them. Or, perhaps, I will just need the comfort of having another beside me.
