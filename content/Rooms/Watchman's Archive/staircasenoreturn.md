# Staircase: No Return
The balustrades of this fearsome staircase are carved like gnarled roots. The stairs lead up to the baroque archives, while a much humbler iron ladder descends into the substructure. Whether up or down, there is no return from this passage. "To advance," Don Ã“scar Zavala wrote of this stair, "is to die to your past hopes and submit to the Haustorium's consumption."
## Staircase: No Return (Locked)
When I approach, the darkness quivers. Hostility? Anticipation? Either way, I can't enter until I ensure an exit.
