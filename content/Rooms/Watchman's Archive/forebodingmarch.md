# Foreboding March
Every step of this stone stairway seems to demand something of the one who walks it, as if to ask if the ascent is truly worth it. The masonry predates the conquest, but the carvings are newer. The Haustorium's protector commissioned them at the turn of the twentieth century, most likely in an attempt to disguise the cracks left by the earthquake.
## Dread (Locked)
Why would I do this? Everyone agrees that to approach the Haustorium means death, most kindly, or any number of worse fates. There may be other Libraries where I can find my answers... there may be an easier end where I need not face this torment. I should speak to someone in La Espinada to discern if this is truly the path for me.
