# Historical Exhibit
By the simplest reckoning, the Haustorium was founded in 1550 when the remaining followers of Leonor Curicuillor swore their pact with the Company Anchorite to form the Colegio de Santa Potenciana. By a more accurate analysis, parts of the complex date back over two millennia before the first emergences of the Fourfold Realm in the 13th century, when this peak was a retreat for nobility and a pilgrimage site for adventurers.
## The Weight of History Presses Down (Locked)
This place is old. The Fourfold Realm was old, but this structure is older still. The Watchman's Tree is old, but the roots of this place were planted long before it. History coils around me like roots here, and wishes to drag me down. Perhaps the past would appreciate being remembered, and let me walk among it.
