# Rooftop Plaza
This was the great gathering-place of the pilgrims to the Ruin of the Roots, whether they came as adventurous journeyers or as victorious kings. The bonfires would be lit, the drums would play, and the sounds and flame of human life would fill the cold and quiet mountains. At one revel, likely toward the end of the first milennium, it is said that the hallucinative fungi of which the celebrants partook were so powerful as to bring dreams to dance upon the rooftops.
## Silent Rooftop(Locked)
Numbing wind blows with no voice. It will trap me if I stay too long. An ardent soul can rekindle the old songs of joy and return soft warmth to the Haustorium.
