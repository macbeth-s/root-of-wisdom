# Cliffside  
The Wayfinders warned against the 'jumping sickness' that overcame some of those who came to these cliffs at night or noon. Perhaps it was this same madness that overtook Alfonso de Soraluce and Leonor Curicuillor midway through their wedding vows. Beatriz Huaylas insisted Leonor pulled them both as her final act of revenge. Luis Bahamonde, the officiant, never spoke on it.  
## Beckoning Plunge (Locked)  
Fog flows off the cliff to join the mists below. Anything caught in its flow goes as well. It must be dispersed back into the valleys.
