# Worm Exhibit  
This exhibit was not of Bengui's design. There is no written record of it prior to the Mutuality Era, but the oldest vessels are clearly in the spidery hand of Father Diego Orgóñez, CA, rector of the Colegio de Santa Potenciana from 1635 until 1669. During the Second Worm War, a secret conclave met here to learn what methods might save the continent. Legend holds that their final strategems were snatched by something scrambling from the shadows and dragged into the roots beneath the building.
