# Resonant Cage  
The cage amplifies the sounds of its resident, but fortunately the room has been well soundproofed by extensive cushioning. When her precious Nevotan was carefully installed here and resumed its great 'song,' Bengui sat with it for so many successive nights she went mostly deaf, worsening her already severe irritability.  
## Deafening Enclosure (Locked)  
The noise from within is immense, unbelievable. I feel it rattle my ribcage. Someone will need to open the room for me; someone who can either withstand the noise or who can quell it.  
**Essential:** Assistance  
**Required:** 6 Heart, 6 Sky, 6 Winter
