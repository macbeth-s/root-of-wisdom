# Menagerie  
This was, in its time, a wonder of the Hidden World. Bengui was grateful to the wards placed by Alejo Sisa, which held in their own tenacious way even through the Metastatic Era and aided in the preservation of her collection. Some cages have lost their resident, but others seem designed for particular monsters which Bengui failed to acquire.  
## Zoonosis (Locked)  
The pallor of disease coats the cages and pens of this once-great menagerie. Feces and rotten flesh mix with the Crowned Growth's defiling influences, threatening to break free and plague the world.
