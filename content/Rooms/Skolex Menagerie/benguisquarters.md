# Bengui's Quarters  
On a frigid night in 1868, Robigo came to speak with Bengui here about some denizen of her menagerie for whom the Protector had a particular distaste. Following the conversation, Bengui seems to have hatched a variety of plans to murder the Dottore and continue her work unmolested. None of these plans came to fruition.  
## Shadow-Trapped Bedroom (Locked)  
Someone died here. Painfully. Whatever remained of them slinked into the shadows, imbuing them with vengeful hatred. I need to cleanse them if I want to keep all my limbs.
