# Ophidiarium  
Even before Bengui showed up with her incubators and enclosures, this room was associated with serpents. The Company Anchorite would lead prayers to Saint Agnes in this room, and before that, the original architects layered serpentine coils throughout the intricate carvings.  
## Serpent-Haunted Enclosure (Locked)  
There are snakes coiled everywhere, even on the crossbar of the door. Their scales are unnerving, and some of them seem to have two heads.  
**Essential:** Assistance  
**Required:** 5 Knock, 5 Scale
