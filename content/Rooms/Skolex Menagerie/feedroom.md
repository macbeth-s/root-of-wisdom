# Feedroom  
The Wayfinders were very fond of their pack animals and fed them splendidly for their faithful service bringing them to the Ruin of the Roots. It is this tradition that led to the infamous 'Llama Sonriente' carving on the back wall of this room. Beatriz Huaylas was especially fond of the llama, whom she said was better company than the Company Anchorite.
