# Sunken Plaza  
When the first Wayfinder reached this mountaintop, when Leonor Curicuillor made her home at the Ruin of the Roots, when Bahamonde founded the Colegio, when the Mutuality first published, when the first members of the faculty were installed, all spoke with reverence of this solitary Paper Tree, which has reached an age unheard of for others of its hearty species despite the rot that now infects it. It is sacred tradition at the Haustorium not to disturb the birds that would nest in its branches or the burrowing things which hide among its roots.  
## Pallid Plaza (Locked)  
The flatstones are colorless. The air is cold and silent. The sky stands still. This is an ever-dying patch of the world's skin. I can excise it, heal it, or end it; but I cannot allow to remain.
