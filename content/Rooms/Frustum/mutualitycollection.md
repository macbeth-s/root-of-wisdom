# Mutuality Collection  
When the bell rang, its tinny sound echoing through the quiet growths of the Haustorium, a masked aide would run through the halls to carefully recover, cleanse, and publish the Mutuality's newest work. Other times, the aide would discover a slip listing various titles and materials the Mutuality required for their research. Rarely, the aide would be killed and consumed.
