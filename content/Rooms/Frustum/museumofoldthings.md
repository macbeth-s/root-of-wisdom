# Museum of Old Things  
This capacious room was once a rooftoop of the frustum, though now the rest of the structure has completely enclosed it. Unwilling to put pagan idols near their holy relics, but forbidden from destroying them by the Curicuillorians, they put this room under the care of Martina la Maga, who arranged it with a transcendent sense of taste and knowledge of history.  
## Draped Exhibits (Locked)  
Dark fabric and heavy canvas covers the displays, marked with forbiddences. To contain the energies of the artifacts, or to appease Calyptra's distaste for them?  
**Essential:** Assistance
