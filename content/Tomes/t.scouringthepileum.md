# Scouring the Pileum
A manual of mycology by Dr. Liladhar Kadam, a known collaborator with (and eventual victim of) the Tragulari.
## I'm Reading...
Kadam's most detailed study concerns the conditions under which the 'half-moon fungus' can be reliably cultivated from its early stages as a kind of rust that grows only on certain stones. 
## I've Read...
Kadam carefully denotes the exact formula for the poison called Oscula lunae, which requires the fruting half-moon fungus and significant mycological skill. He also notes the ability to turn the fruiting bodies of the stinging hydnoid into a 'death-ink.'
