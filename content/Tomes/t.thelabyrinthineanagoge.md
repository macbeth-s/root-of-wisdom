# The Labyrinthine Anagoge
Isidoro Dahlmann explores different hermeneutical approaches to death and the afterlife in the interpretation of history.
## I'm Reading...
'To die is to cease living'; 'to die is to go down'; 'to die is to pass the White Door for a final time.' All of these are, in some sense, true, as the Histories are true. But as not all Dead enter the Mansus, not all which occurs enters the Histories.'
## I've Read...
As the Hours each have their realms, Dahlmann surmises they also hold incompatable conceptions of death. Because of this, no immortal can ever truly escape the possibility of death, 'save for those never born in the labyrinth of life.'
