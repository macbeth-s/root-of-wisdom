# The Geminiad ii
A fragile manuscript, illuminated with twinned shapes of sad and luminous beauty, and with all the phases of the moon. It might be as old as the seventh century, but the language - Fucine - is much older. The cover is a dark and exotic leather with a smooth, almost chitinous surface, decorated with jasper.

## I've Read...
The second volume of the Geminiad suggests that these seven corrupted immortals have been accorded the privileges of Names of the Witch-and-Sister - or perhaps the Sister-and-Witch. It reminds us that the Twins unite what is apart, and that the 'Crime of the Sky' is in some sense a supreme joining. And it speaks at length about the sadness of the seven, the sadness of mothers whose children are forever lost, and far worse than lost.
