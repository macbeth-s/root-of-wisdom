# Pink Onyx Tablet
Supposedly copied from a tablet of pink onyx which serves as the Covenant-stone of the Tomb of Lies - the token which gives that Library shelter beneath the Watchman’s Tree.
## I'm Reading...
‘Humankind faltered in its first ascent to the Branches of the Watchman’s Tree. Our History burdened us, so we left it below, yet its shadow followed close as we rose ever higher…’
## I've Read...
The Tablet expounds the dangers (and rewards) of erasing the old in search of the new. Along the way, it reveals the secret of the Noonspring Draught, which can be refined from a Sight Enduring by the application of Transcendence and Ascendence, with adequate Rose-aspect.
