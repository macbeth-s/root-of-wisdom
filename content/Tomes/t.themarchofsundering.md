# The March of Sundering
A fanciful biography of the Liberator's military career, with special attention to his early religious beliefs.
## I'm Reading...
The Liberator is born to the heights of criollo wealth, cared for by an enslaved woman who encourages his rambunctious and rebellious nature, and fomenting his resentment towards his absent parents. The narrative then turns to battles, told through intense scenes of violent imagery.
## I've Read...
After issuing his Decree of War to the Death, the Liberator speaks powerful Edge-rites over his army, transforming a small political victory into an invincible audacity that overwhelms his foes. Skaptodons are said to accompany his host into battle.
