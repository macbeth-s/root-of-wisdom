# The Evening Queen
An account by Baron Fabricius on the short-lived marriage of Charles XII, the Evening King, to Anna Mazepa, the daughter of his enemy-turned-ally.
## I'm Reading...
During his exile in Moldavia, Charles meets the sharp-minded Anna. The two draw up plans to revitalize the waning Swedish Empire before developing a shared infatuation. Their marriage in 1712 is celebrated amongst their companions, but Fabricius believes its occurrence on ‘the day of the Sun’s shadow’ ensured its tragic end.
## I've Read...
In the Skirmish at Bender, Anna is consumed by the flames which lead to Charles’ capture. When returned to Sweden, he enacts their plans, what he calls ‘her final threads,’ with exacting deftness. Fabricius confesses a suspicion of these successes and of the king, ‘for he is advised by her spirit, who speaks not from the sky, but from beyond the dim proscenium.’
