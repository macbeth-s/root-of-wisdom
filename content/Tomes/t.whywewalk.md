# Why We Walk
In 1910, the few true Wayfinders who practiced their traditions met at Huayna Picchu to reflect and rededicate themselves. Someone took notes, likely in secret.
## I'm Reading...
Woman, young, in Aymara : 'Liz√°rraga betrayed us, what remains for us is now consigned.' Man, old, in Quechua: 'he will be inundated and obliviated. We need not preocuppy ourselves with revenge but with survival.'
## I've Read...
Woman, young, in Quechua: 'In the days before the Fourfold, when our wings hummed still and our skin would not stay stuck, the shell-ones knew that were we not to offer blood and souls to the beasts that dwell in mountains, we would all of us be ended. As long as Q'isa permits our rites at the Ruin, we need not fear. We walk now so all might someday escape.'
