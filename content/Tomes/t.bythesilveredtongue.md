# By the Silvered Tongue
Beatriz, the Ruby Widow, details ‘the sharper histories’ of the Spanish conquest of Mexico in which the Sisterhood of the Triple Knot played a vital role - through their control of interpretation.
## I'm Reading...
The Sisterhood disperses their emissaries amongst the conquistadors, hoping to install themselves as the foremost powers. They find an opportunity in a girl held captive by the Maya, ‘whose lips knew the Grail,’ and entail her assistance in the conquest. With deft eloquence, she subdues the leaders of the Triple Alliance, and ultimately leads the conquistadors to victory; the Sisterhood hails her as the Matriarch of the New World.
## I've Read...
The Sisterhood entreats the girl (now a woman) to join them, but she refuses, claiming their kind will wither in the Dry Land. Following the Sun’s division, her prophecy is proven true as the tribunals of the Inquisition drive them out of the Americas. Despite her rebuke, the Sisterhood still venerates her, ‘for war was the Mother’s first libation.’
