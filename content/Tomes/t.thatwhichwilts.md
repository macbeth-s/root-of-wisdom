# That Which Wilts
Candelaria Ponce writes of the Contentum, a triumvirate of powers she believes act parallel - or perhaps counterwise - to the operations of the Calyptra.
## I'm Reading...
‘The Flowers of the Calyptra hide knowledge, but all flowers serve three functions: to attract; to propagate; and to bear fruit. So too do their blooms, and it is the Contentum who reap their harvests…’
## I've Read...
‘It is the Contentum who take the scraps, in whose jaws they dissolve. Thus knowledge ceases in form. Yet it lives on within them. Is it a consequence of their acts, or their purpose?’
