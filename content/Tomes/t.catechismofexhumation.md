# Catechism of Exhumation
A secret manual for initiates of the Company Anchorite. The Spanish edition was revised and redacted in 1874.
## I'm Reading...
"The sepulchre is a door, not a lock. Enter the gravestone and bring to the present that power which would rather be confined to History."
## I've Read...
"Confuse yourself not with the consumption of dead flesh, which leads to paleness or sinful fruitfulness. Seek instead the flesh and bone as relic and as key. Preserve it, protect it, and, when you must, wield it."
