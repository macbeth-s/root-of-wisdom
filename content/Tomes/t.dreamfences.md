# Dreamfences
Blanca Quinteras Indice's first and only surrealist novel, which many consider led directly to her decision to return to the "certainties of poetry."
## I'm Reading...
Quinteras Indice alludes to the little she knew of Maya imagery as her desperate protagonist stumbles through a jungle of 'glaring shadows' and 'cats a hundred strong.'
## I've Read...
In the final pages, Kukulkan presents the protagonist with a riddle, to which the only answer is her name. But as she is an unnamed protagonist, she fails. A two-headed serpent slithers from her head and devours her in four bites.
