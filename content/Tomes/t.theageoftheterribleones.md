# The Age of the Terrible Ones
Socorro Valenzuela examines stories of the Terrible Ones, a saurian people said to have known the Hours, and which died out before the advent of humanity, possibly even the Carapace Cross.
## I'm Reading...
When the gods-from-stone still reigned, their strivings created life like sparks; life like the Terrible Ones. A Tyrant rose amongst them, and led his people against the Hours in a bid for their sovereignty. Yet the relentless cruelty of Stone prevailed, and evening fell upon them. Now they are buried, but their remnants found refuge in the dawn of the Carapace Cross, in the vestigial memories passed through their children.
## I've Read...
Valenzuela dismisses the Terrible Ones as an anthropocentric fiction, a projection of humanity onto the voiceless beasts of the past. However, the Cross connection intrigues her, and she draws parallels between the monarchal Thritige-kind and the feathered serpent prominent throughout Mesoamerica.
