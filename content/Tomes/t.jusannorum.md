# Jus Annorum
All (or almost all) mortals are aware of their limited lifespan, but few know of the Cindered Tally, which allots to each person their set amount of prospective Years. This treatise by the Blue Liturgist was written to help curtail its abuse, which vastly increased following the Intercalate.
## I'm Reading...
Though the Church quelled many of those dealt in Years, the survivors evolved into the criminal organizations known as Merchants of Years, a number of them supported by renegade priests. The Southern Hemisphere is oddly devoid of their influence, because of - or perhaps, leading to - the deep loathing they incite in occult communities below the Equator.
## I've Read...
‘A Year is not merely Time, but the unrealized energy of forty-two million human heartbeats. Each of us have our allotments portioned by the Cindered, granted access to these days by the rights bestowed upon us at birth; but these rights, as with all we possess, may be stolen.’
