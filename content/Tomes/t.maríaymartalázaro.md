## I'm Reading...
Despite being the children of creole nobility, the girls are orphaned and make their living by begging. In an especially fanciful plot point, an earthquake separates the girls and leads them into the care of two vastly different guardians.
## I've Read...
Marta, the quieter of the two, is taken in to study at a Colegio high in the Andes, where she is sealed away as an anchoress. María indulges a life of crime and debauchery which makes for much more interesting reading. Featuring heavily in the moralizing prose is the "ruddy ruination" that brings about María's doom, which she brews from flowers in various scandalous scenes.
