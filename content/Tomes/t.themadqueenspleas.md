# The Mad Queen's Pleas
A biography of Queen Joanna the Mad after she was confined to a small summer palace by her son Charles V despite their nominal coregency.
## I'm Reading...
"Unannounced and uninvited, the bearded mendicant Friar Uriel came to find our lady's ear. His meditations did not seem to bring our lady comfort, but they did seem to bring her certainty."
## I've Read...
"In fits of lucidity not seen since her confinement, our lady wrote many impassioned pleas to her son on the need to abandon the old ways of faith or risk ruin. Her pleas must have found purchase, for her friar was named chaplain on a great armada to the New World the next year."
