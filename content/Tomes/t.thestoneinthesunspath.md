# The Stone in the Sun's Path
An account of the Earthshaker's visit to Tiwanaku, related by the sage called 'Micaela' to the leadership of the Viceroyalty during the uncertainties of the Intercalate. 
## I'm Reading...
The Earthshaker, according to Micaela, was so impressed by the masonry of the ancient city that he set out to rebuild the Rock of the Owl in its likeness, and in doing so 'draw the paths of the Suns' to the city.
## I've Read...
Micaela advises the distraught nobility wisely that the sun's paths may now be stained with blood, but that they still cross the sky above. She also reminds them of the power of "our traditional stone-ways, whose might could quiet volcanoes with the aid of their silent friends."
