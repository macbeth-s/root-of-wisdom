# The Divisions of Time
The horologist, demonologist, and adept Jöseph Kittering elaborates his theories on the shape of the ‘Prime Aspect,’ from which he postulates the motions or meanings of all other aspects derive.
## I'm Reading...
Kittering is frenzied, near-incomprehensible, in his writing, but he shows an inclination towards the Glory-aligned Principles of Lantern and Forge. He’s clearly obsessed with the Intercalate and hopes to somehow emulate, or perhaps recreate it, to enter the world into its ‘Final History.’
## I've Read...
Abruptly, Kittering begins discoursing on the dead Hour called Seven-Coils and her ‘golden turnings,’ by which she defined and destroyed Histories. He believes that these turnings, or their successors, remain to consume the thousand demi-real branches of the Histories; ominously, he hopes to control this power himself, ‘to right the unbalanced roots of Time.’
