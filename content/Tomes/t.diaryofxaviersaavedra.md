# Diary of Xavier Saavedra
The private ruminations and neurotic confessions of Father Xavier Saavedra, CA, final rector of the Colegio de Santa Potenciana and failed defender of the Company Anchorite in Spanish America. 
## I'm Reading...
Saavedra was deeply aware of the political pressures against his order, blaming their isolation on 'the calumnous chatter of Birds in the ears of these faded monarchs, and the writhings of Worms beneath our faithful and sincere feet.' He is forced to make several unsavory decisions in the name of preserving the Colegio: he accepts Gabriela Ber's offer to bring her ill-gotten relics, and sells off much of the Haustorium's gold. 
## I've Read...
In the final entries, ending on 25 April 1770, Saavedra seems to have become increasingly depressed and desperate. He writes of long conversations as leader of a 'council of five' whom he identifies as Chor, Shapt, Ereb, and Phost in a sign of his increasing embrace of heretical ideas. Many of these notes make reference to the comments of 'our host, who promises our liberation through a particular Sacrament I would never have before considered.'
