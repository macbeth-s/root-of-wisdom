# Identifying the Heresies of the Company Anchorite
The Inquisitor Adán Menéndez was convinced that the Company Anchorite was a heretical order. He dedicated his life to proving as much.
## I'm Reading...
Menéndez strives mightly to identify which of the "suppressed and idolatrous Beings" the Company served, as they clearly did not embody any of the "virtues of our ancient and radiant faith."
## I've Read...
Menéndez identifies Santa Agnès, San Vicente Martir, San Huberto, or Santa Lucia as all possible "heterodox influences" on the Company. He accuses them also of engaging in illegal traffic with smugglers who provide the 'glassfinger toxins which form the basis of their unholy Sacrament.'
