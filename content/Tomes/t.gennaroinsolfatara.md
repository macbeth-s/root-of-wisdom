A 17th-century oratorio from the soprano-composer Lilla Donelli on the days before the execution of St Januarius, narrated by his wet nurse Eusebia.
## I'm Reading...
Judge Dragontius condemns Januarius and his companions to death by wild bears, but the animals dole out only affection. When cast into a furnace, the flames refuse to harm them. Frustrated, he orders their beheading, but Eusebia states Januarius hoped for this outcome all alongâ€¦
## I've Read...
After his neck gives way to the axe, his blood gushes forth. Eusebia collects a little, but the rest seeps into the earth. The final recitative explains his soul flows at the furthest reaches of the world, staunching the leak of its blood and guarding the small wounds in its skin.
