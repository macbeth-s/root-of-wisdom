In my solitude, Saint Agnes has encircled me. She speaks in my left ear and my right, and she tells me who I truly am. If the faithful speak these riddles well, and open themselves to Saint Agnes' merciful scars, she might encircle us all and in so doing let us all escape the cells in which we dwell. This is why our protectors serve her.'
