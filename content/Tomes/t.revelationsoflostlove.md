# Revelations of Lost Love
The prophecies of anchoress Madeline Cross, dedicated to Saint Hubert of the White Copse.
## I'm Reading...
Though the Company Anchorite was expelled, the anchoress remained, cared for by Guillermo Alcaraz, one of the few Brothers who stayed. He compiled the few notes she returned to the outside world here, though they are decidedly more hesitant than her forbears' writings.
## I've Read...
I am the last who will dwell in this cloister. When my last protector passes, I will truly be alone. This is the sorrow Saint Hubert knows, and I see it in his eyes, hear the lament in my heart. Is he who my protector serves? Must I still serve him once all else is gone? Perhaps. But before all else, I shall remain.'
