# Soralucian Cabasset
A lightly dented and strange-smelling war-helmet.<br>Initial Location: [[rectorsstudy|Rector's Study]]
## I'm Studying...  
This must have belonged to Alfonso de Soraluce, the conquistador with grandiose aspirations who came to the Haustorium in 1550 to make Leonor his wife and establish himself in the Noble Retreat.  
## I've Read...  
Soraluce failed to consider the intersecting goals of his own brilliant chaplain, who would apparently keep this helmet in his study (as a trophy? as a memory?). He also failed to notice, it seems, the seeds of the Crowned Growth which unmistakeably reside in the leather straps and cling to the underside. They have been there a long, long time... perhaps even at Gallo?
