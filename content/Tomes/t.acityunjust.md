# A City Unjust
An anonymous polemic on the City Unbuilt, the prophesied haven where Hours hold no sway. In the minds of mortals and immortals alike, it is hailed as a sanctuary of freedom, but the author suggests otherwise…
## I'm Reading...
‘Though the laws of Hours restrain us, they serve to grant freedoms we could not access otherwise. In their absence, who then upholds the Law? If the Hours or Names cannot, then the Long must; and they have hardened their hearts against mortals.’
## I've Read...
‘When the City rises, the City will be a flaw. And all flaws, in time, must be corrected - from strength without or else be shattered from within.’
