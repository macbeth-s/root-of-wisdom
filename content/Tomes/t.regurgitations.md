# Regurgitations
An attempt by Sonia Quiroz to re-enact the revolting visions she experienced while seasick on a trans-Pacific voyage of the Hebe Stanton.

After faking peace, Tia Lilit waits for Mama Killa to sleep and replaces her tea with syrup of ipecac. When Mama Killa vomits, hands and a gruesome head burst from her mouth, which unhinges through some remarkably skilled prosthetics.
