# Revelations of Hidden Love
The prophecies of anchorite Isais de Ja√©n, dedicated to Saint Vincent Martyr. 
## I'm Reading...
The anchorite invokes the crows that guarded the bones of Saint Vincent after his martyrdom and during the Moorish invasions, praising their vigilance and their intelligence. 
## I've Read...
When I die in my cloister, may the crows come and carry my femur to Lisbon, my hip-bone to Zaragoza, my skull to Lima. May we all be so scattered and be so treasured as we die. The crows know the value of the small treasures and storied bones. This is why our protectors serve him.'
