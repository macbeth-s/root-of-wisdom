Barbosa takes the story as proof of the Twins’ nature-within, proclaiming the two as the many-armed successors of Blomberende-kind, who were many-winged. Unsurprising for a Brotherhood member to claim this of gods-who-were-flesh, but a postscript suggests that a flowering blade can summon a joyous air of sacrifice.
