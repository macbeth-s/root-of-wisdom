# The Pale Light Sutra
This sutra lined the cavern walls of the tomb where Arutrur, regarded as the most elusive of the Shadowless Kings, was laid to rest.
## I'm Reading...
The Sutra focuses on the Three-Valved Door, the gate closest to the Glory through which many Long have passed. All the gods-from-light entered the Mansus through it, but they may not be the only Hours to have done so.
## I've Read...
‘To every Hour, its Color; to every Gate, its Song.’
