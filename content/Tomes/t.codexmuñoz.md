# Codex Muñoz
A sixteenth-century record regarding the Owl Warriors, covert combatants of the Triple Alliance, from the collection of the late Dr Ernesto Muñoz.
## I'm Reading...
Across the sea, the Scarred honed his Legion. Upon the lake, the Horned trained her Owls. They prophesied a great battle between their forces, of dart against talon; but the Universal Monarchs felled her Warriors before it could come to pass.
## I've Read...
The author fears the absence of the Owl Warriors, insistent that their role must be filled lest new foes rise from Nowhere. They demonstrate how a leaf brewed with Scale-aspect can create a deadly ink, claiming its use can draw suitable replacements from a supposed Seventh History.
