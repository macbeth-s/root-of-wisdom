# The Satiation of the Sun
Delilah Molotla's seminal study on blood sacrifices across various solar traditions. In the foreward, she explains she wrote in Nahuatl so "no one starts any White Legend shit with my work."
## I'm Reading...
Molotla begins with a survey of Western sun sacrifices of children, captives, and the honored elect. She then turns east, to the Shadowless Empire's ancient war rites, which she claims continued much older practices begun in service of the Egg Unhatching.
## I've Read...
The final section addresses the Church of the Unconquered Sun, which Molotla argues has continued sun sacrifice through its many wars of conquest. The text is not entirely political, however, as her concluding thought emphasizes that the Sun-in-Splendor never drank of blood, and yet the Sun-in-Rags has always bled, and the Seven-Coils' blood was gold.
