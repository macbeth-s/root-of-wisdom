Quispe details certain practices afforded to the Fourfold Princes, to preserve them both in life and in death. Certain means of desiccation could render puremost memories of their remains, which could in turn be elaborated into extensions of indelible life. He planned for these means to keep Leonor alive, but after her demise and his subsequent death in the aftermath, these came to naught once the Company Anchorite took over all subsequent funerary rites.
