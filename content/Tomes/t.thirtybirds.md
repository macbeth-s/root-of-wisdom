# Thirty Birds
A recording of Kitty Mazarine’s fuging-tune ‘Thirty Birds’ performed by Crossrow’s New Dawn Chorus.
## I'm Reading...
The story says Kitty Mazarine composed this from an unknown melody she learned after dreaming of mirrors. A more obscure retelling claims the mirrors were made of black glass, that she saw not her reflection, but a night-feathered being who stared back with her very own eyes.
## I've Read...
Four voice lines harmonize before diverging into a complex, almost dissonant, series of countermelodies. Gradually, they drop out until only a single soloist remains. The choir suddenly rejoins to echo her words of reflections and reunion, of dreams dreamt by no one, of worlds beyond the bounds.
