In the days of the old, red sun, the gods-who-are warred amongst themselves. Every battle strained the weave of the world until threads snapped and unraveled.

The Chancel’s mandates regulate the Hours, but they do not rule them. When paradox pulls at the Histories, their edicts release the tension to ensure their persistence. Menard speculates whether their presence or their absence is necessary for the Histories’ ultimate resolution, concluding with his signature proverb, ‘Silence is the purest harmony.’
