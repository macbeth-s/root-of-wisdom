# Sins Primordial and Sins Forgiven
A humanist text by the excommunicated, rehabilitated, and again excommunicated Father Tirso Izquierdo, of Cuman√°.
## I'm Reading...
Tirso writes of Ixion and Tantalus, and warns that 'their crimes are crimes still, especially where Xenodice's shadow is cast.' He advises supplication to St. Julian for forgiveness of this particular sin. 
## I've Read...
Tirso also discusses Ado and Medusa, who 'saw what should not be seen and ask desperately for what is to be seen.' He says that such matters are left only to St. Tentreto, who even now has little power to forgive. 'This sin is forbidden no longer but also forgiven no longer, except perhaps where St. Tentreto and St. Lucia might intervene.'
