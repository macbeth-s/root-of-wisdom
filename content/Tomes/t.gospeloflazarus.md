# Gospel of Lazarus
An iconoclastic account on the Galilean Carpenter, describing his descent into Nowhere following his entombment.
## I'm Reading...
Solar doctrines declared the Sun’s light fell upon every place in and beyond the Dream and Wake. Nowhere proved an inconvenience to the uniformity of this belief, and is often implied to have helped cause the Church’s East-West Divide. Of course, these differences ceased to matter after the Intercalate.
## I've Read...
The Galilean Carpenter enters Nowhere wreathed in warmth and light and draws its weary Dead. He foretells their return to the world above, when life will burn within them once more, urging the importance of keeping Nowhere’s lamps lit. ‘In Darkness, the brightest Light; from Night, the brightest Dawn.’
