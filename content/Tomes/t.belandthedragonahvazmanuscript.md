# Bel and the Dragon (Ahvaz Manuscript)
A puzzling archaeological find of the last century. 
## I'm Reading...
There was a great dragon which the Babylonians revered, but Daniel came to slay it with barley-cakes and camel-skins.'
## I've Read...
The dragon retches, but does not die. Daniel exploits the opportunity to snatch three eggs from the dragon's nest. What follows is fragmentary, but the Babylonians are plunged into despair and Daniel gloats to the king about how his false idols protect 'naught but Logos which ought remain with us, uncoverable through savour-secrets and faith.'
