# A Tower in Ruins
The phonograph is hermetically sealed in a heliotrope canister with the words A TOWER IN RUINS in nine languages on both sides. There is no other identifying information at all.
## I'm Reading...
A recording of uncertain origin: inexplicably compelling poetry recorded by a speaker with a soft, strained nearly disappeared voiceâ€¦ in the language called Vak, which probably isn't spoken by more than a few dozen living scholars.
## I've Read...
The poem speaks of the four wings of war, the four mouths of the king, the four rays of the sun, the four corners of the stone, and the four realms of its own great construction. It speaks of how the order of four may be chosen, and Eternity brought nearer, through the careful recitation of wound-words before the tombs that lie.
