# Journal of Governor Edward Geryk
As the last embers of the War of the Roads burnt out in Europe, the headstrong Governor Edward Geryk carried on their cause in the Evening Isles. Accounted here are his final few months.
## I'm Reading...
Geryk is a zealot of the then-defunct Sovereigns of the Leashed Flame, refusing to recognize their mortal successors. He seeks to establish the Sovereignty of the Flame Eternal in the Evening Isles, planning out an ambitious set of strategies interspersed with chess notations.
## I've Read...
Geryk plans to siege St Thomas and from there conquer the isles with a Forge-relic of St. Spark. These never came to pass, as Geryk and his subordinates disappeared in 1627; the journal ends before then, but the last few entries speak glowingly of the powerful Black Queens of Raven Isle - where many soucouyants are sequestered in exile.
