# Menagerie Records Vol. 2
Nac√©ra Bengui's all-too-gleeful record of visitors to the Haustorium maimed, killed, or merely horrified by the denizens of her menagerie.
## I'm Reading...
March 23, 185x: two Know from the North came seeking tinctures and skaptodon fangs. I told them I am not an apothecary nor a poacher and let Lucius give them a good fright. Total one extremity and one mortal life.
## I've Read...
June 18, 186x: bespectacled faculty held a mirror to each cage in turn, which Proserpina especially seemed to dislike. Hatched Living Relic from egg while visitor droned on. Long conversation about scrining and other uninteresting business followed before tally was paid. Total one small bite to the forearm.
