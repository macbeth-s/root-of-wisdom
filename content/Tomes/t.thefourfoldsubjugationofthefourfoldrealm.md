# The Fourfold Subjugation of the Fourfold Realm
In which Delilah Molotla draws analogies between the conquest of the Americas and paleolithic myths.
## I'm Reading...
The conquerers did not serve the Corrivality, but they did neglect their powers. The Sapan Inka were not ignorant of the Sun's many armaments, but they did not wield them lightly (or, in some Histories, at all).'
## I've Read...
Molotla blames Calyptra, 'whom the Fourfold respected as Q'isa, that solemn incubator,' for the Fourfold's defeat, despite their superior civilization. She acknowledges, in addition, the crucial role played by the Crowned Growth in the savagery of conquest.
