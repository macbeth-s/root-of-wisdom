# Faculty Minutes, 1936
The minutes of a frantic and terrified meeting of the Haustorium's faculty. 
## I'm Reading...
Following the theft of Friar Menard's tapestry, the Dottore fell into a vitriolic tirade against the faculty, condemning them for - in his eyes - allowing it to happen. Nothing they say or do placates him, and he soon sets about releasing his rage throughout the Haustorium.
## I've Read...
This was the last meeting ever called by the Dottore, after which the various faculty members retreated and isolated themselves to their respective wing of the Library. A shakily written postscript states that although they are now apart, they are still bound in their shared purpose, 'as Quilaco with Leonor.'
