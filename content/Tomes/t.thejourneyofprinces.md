# The Journey of Princes
A Purépecha text translated into Nahuatl by the lapidarist and socialite Alejandra Chalchihuitl.
## I'm Reading...
She dwells in the Wood, and is the Wood in which she dwells. The winged princes flock into her embrace, where they might escape the rime of Glory. ‘Xarátanga embraces; Xarátanga renews; Xarátanga preserves herself within herself.’
## I've Read...
The blood of their Father flows through her, yet she is not their Sister. She is without a House, yet a House stands within her. The Moon is unseen, yet the Moon ever shines upon her. When those who do not understand drink what is blessed with her Nectar, they shall.
