# From Darkness Into Darkness
The author, identified as ‘Silk-and-Silver’, writes about the Lower Limbs of the Watchman’s Tree, those libraries in the care of Nowhere-Hours: the Monastery of the Fifth Cup, the Grove of Green Immortals, and, of course, the Haustorium.

‘To learn more is to understand that there is always more to learn. Only with knowledge can we come to comprehend what we lack. The Watchman’s Tree is rooted in these paradoxes, for which there exists no resolution. So it is only the Lower Limbs where that resolution may be found.’

Silk-and-Silver mentions the Ink of Containment known as viridimentum, noting its absence in the other libraries. He reasons that it is either a secret kept by the Lower Limbs, or that its use outside of the Lower Limbs would invite the presence of their respective Hours. Nevertheless, he describes how certain ferments (such as the Chicha Bullido) can give way to viridimentum if they are kept awash in Moon-power.
