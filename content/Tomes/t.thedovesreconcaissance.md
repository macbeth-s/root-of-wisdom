# The Dove's Reconcaissance
During the high days of the Haustorical Mutuality, a nervous Wayfinder who wished to complete a pilgrimage to the Ruin of the Roots trained a dove to scout ahead.
## I'm Reading...
The dove, it becomes increasingly clear, is not a mere trained pet but a skintwisting chor-fragment. It flies to what must be the Noble Retreat and perches at window, joining in the songs of the distorted fungus-being within. 
## I've Read...
The songs of the fungus are low and sweet; old Quechua songs from the Curicuillorian days. The dove sees, for a moment, a woman come from the haustoria's tendril, 'as if drawn by our shared emanations of chor-rhythms.' The author concludes that 'even the last Curicuillorian, then, has joined that Blight, adding her song to their foul production'
