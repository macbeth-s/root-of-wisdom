# Le Visage Fondu
A bronze cast of a face in serene repose.

Initial Location: [[grandentrance]]
## I'm Studying...
The method of creation at first seems to be cire perdu, in the ancient style, but the base bears the signet of Kume TsÅ«ten, dated 1837, the same year he left the residence in Avignon where he lived with the reclusive adept Celine Brissette.
## I've Studied...
The scultpture bears a resemblance, certainly, to the few photographs of Brissette that remain. The traces of periost on the cast's interior suggest Brissette was indeed a raggy, and that Kume used his arts to give her the beautiful ending the Sun-in-Rags expected of her.
