## I'm Reading...
The study is dedicated to three aides who perished in the course of Lacombe's research, as well as to (in much larger type) "Our Generous Benefactor." 
## I've Read...
Lacombe includes detailed formulae for the synthesis of a potent combustible oil from a rare mushroom called foxlame, using mycological techniques. 'Further research,' he notes 'should concern itself with the application and subsequent immolation of this oil when spread on stone edifices.'
