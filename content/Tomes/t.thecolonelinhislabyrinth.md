# The Colonel in His Labyrinth
A semi-historical account of the sorrowful last days of the Liberator by a prominent fabulist.
## I'm Reading...
The Liberator becomes consumed with a cold-hearted somberness after his exile and increasing isolation from power. One by one, in fantastical ways, he orchestrates vicious and impossible revenge against his former allies turned rivals.
## I've Read...
The Liberator takes it upon himself to brew the deadly ink perinculate from coca leaves and inscribe vicious gloating on the skin of Admiral Padilla. He curses General Santander to put out his own eyes so that they may no longer interfere with eating. Obando is interred in a pit of worms to be devoured slowly. The sickened, wizened Liberator finally reaches his death as a mercy from his Scarred Captain, 'the guide of my final end and the agent of my redemption.'
