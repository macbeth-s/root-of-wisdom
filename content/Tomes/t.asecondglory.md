# A Second Glory
The priest Juceh celebrates the extirpation of the Gods-who-were-stone, those Hours who preceded humanity.
## I'm Reading...
Juceh engages in an apologia for the destruction of the Hours: they were old, they were cowardly, they were vile, their time had passed, and it was the shining destiny of humankind to seize the House through glorious battle.
## I've Read...
Juceh recounts how the Hour called Seven-Coils was slain in battle by the Colonel, how the Grail devoured the Hour called Tide, and how the Egg Unhatching 'fled like a coward'. He's quite vituperative about the Egg Unhatching. He warns darkly against its return.
