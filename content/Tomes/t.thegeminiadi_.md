# The Geminiad i
A fragile manuscript, illuminated with twinned shapes of sad and luminous beauty, and with all the phases of the moon. It might be as old as the seventh century, but the language - Fucine - is much older. The cover is tooled goatskin decorated with garnet.
## I'm Reading...
These pages outline the nature, and the doctrines, of an Hour that weaves together the willing, an Hour that is sought beneath the moon and at the water's edge: the Sister-and-Witch. The language is wilful, knotty, poetic. It'll take some untangling.
## I've Read...
The first volume of the Geminiad reminds us that the Sister-and-Witch has been known to manifest as the Witch-and-Sister - and that this face is always hungry, while the other face may heal. It implies connections between the Sister-and-Witch and the Hours of the upper Mansus - especially the lunar Hour called the Meniscate - but it is ambiguous on whether the Sister-and-Witch is a Mansus-Hour proper. And it speaks at length about the sadness of the two-who-are-one, the sadness that remains from their time as flesh.
