# Purify, Polish, Profit
Kume TsÅ«ten's manual on fine metalworking.
## I'm Reading...
Kume is detailed in his descriptions and arrogant in his conclusions. He celebrates gold and denigrates many other metals. 
## I've Read...
In one chapter, Kume dwells on how gold does not tarnish or corrode, and provides various solutions that can be used to remove fungal growth from gold jewelry. He recommends using 'the condensation of light' for some growths that have particular malign power, which can be done 'with Sky-power and my many impeccable techniques.'
