# So That They Might Be Forgotten
Political-alchemical treatises by Ursula Sabès arguing for a particular and untested punishment for the deposed slavers of the Evening Isles.
## I'm Reading...
Sabès loathed the old powers of her island home and spent many years devising (fantasizing?) ways to punish and torment them in equal measure.
## I've Read...
Conversations with a mysterious visitor lead Sabès to change tactics, deciding eventually that there would be no better punishment than 'for even the memory of them to pass from this earth.' She took inspiration from the Long of Noon in synthesizing her vengeance, made by 'catalyzing the albedic essence into an obliviating draught.'
