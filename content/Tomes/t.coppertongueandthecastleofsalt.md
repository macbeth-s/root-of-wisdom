# Coppertongue and the Castle of Salt
A fable told by some British mariners as they rounded the Land of Flames, recorded by Isidoro Dahlmann. 
## I'm Reading...
Coppertongue is a lusty young sailor who does all he can to defy the orders of Captain Snow, his dutiful commander. Snow is forced to scuttle his ship to avoid capture, but Coppertongue, hidden in the brig with a lover, does not realize and sinks to the bottom of the sea. 
## I've Read...
For the underwater portions of the narrative, which are mostly in a dreamlike rhyme, Coppertongue is suddenly female. She comes to a great castle made of salt and torments its mer-king as she did Captain Snow, painting the castle with 'silver nowear-paint maid from ink of moon-skwid.' Somehow, the castle falls at last to arson, and the merking is left 'black to bone and mersifull still.'
