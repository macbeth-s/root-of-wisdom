# The Deaths of the Moon (Unpublished "Manuscript")
Killasimi is a difficult language when written skillfully, but this collection of sinewy fibers requires skill to even be identified as script.
## I'm Reading...
This must be an early work of the Mutuality, as hidden underneath the woven text is older text of ink on anthropoderm parchment. The once-different voices that made up the Mutuality seem to converge through the writing of the text itself.
## I've Read...
It is chor that we should join, one voice seems to argue. It is phost, argues another, such that our contributions might sparkle. It is shapt, claims another, for force. There are at least two other voices at work, and by the end some accord seems to be reached: an experimental use of the full-moon mode such that they may grow, then publish, then balance, then begin again, "under the care of Our Protector."
