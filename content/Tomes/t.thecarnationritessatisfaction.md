# The Carnation Rites: Satisfaction
The third volume of para-Martinezist operations, traditionally attributed to Pierre André de Grainville. The subtle tongue he employed is left untranslated for clarity.
## I'm Reading...
Theurgic rites invoke and invite the presence of ‘the Honey, the Fruit, and the Marrow,’ an entity (or set of entities) which can awaken the ‘Ecstasies of Reunion’ kept dormant in life. 
## I've Read...
‘Only in emerging from the depthless sea of Death may the Sun birth more hues, the Earth bear more delights; for pleasures burn brightest in the dark.’
