# Sky-River Voyages
An anonymous wayfinder describes night-journeys taken through the starlit river called Mayu.
## I'm Reading...
The Mayu at times seems to be the Painted River in the Mansus, but by its shape it is decisively the Via Lactea itself, in the Wake.
## I've Read...
The author avoids the moon, which they associate with confusion and death. Instead, they spend time among the chilly stars of Mayu and capture the sights and sensations of these star-memories in ascendant harmonies which have found their way into many secret code-songs of the mountains.
