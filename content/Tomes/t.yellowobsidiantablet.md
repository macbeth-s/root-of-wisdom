# Yellow Obsidian Tablet
Supposedly copied from a tablet of yellow obsidian which serves as the Covenant-stone of Crossrow - the token which gives that Library shelter beneath the Watchman's Tree.
## I'm Reading...
‘When humankind transcended the Branches, Eternity erased those beyond them. No skin nor shell could shield us from its gaze, and we lamented. But when our cries crossed the horizon, the Leak sang back his Nesting Song…’
## I've Read...
The Tablet expounds the dangers of seeking the equivocal Hour sometimes called the Leak, and also of rejecting his rule, as he protects what is constrained. Along the way, it reveals the secret of Uzult (where the Shard shows shining gifts) - refined with the arts of Transcendence and Ascendence from the gold-essence, in conjunction with ample Lantern-aspect.
