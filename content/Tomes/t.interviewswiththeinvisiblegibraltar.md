# Interviews with the Invisible: Gibraltar
An interview with a newly-initiated Edge-long - supposedly conducted by the journalist Amadea Franciacorta in the aftermath of the 1925 Reckoner War.
## I'm Reading...
If an Edge-dyad truly arose from the Reckoner War, they've conducted very subtle battles. It's much more probable that the journalist (or the actual author) employed it as an conflict-rich setting for their work; but described here are the Iron Forms - that is, the higher lessons of the Colonel.
## I've Read...
It's a duty, and it's a pleasure. There are disciplines and there are discomforts, but that's the soldier's life, and scars are strength. My Foe and I grow stronger, every day. He might eventually grow strong enough to kill me, or I him, and that would be the end of us both. I think I would regret that. With enough patience and discipline, even hatred becomes only another colour. So our little war goes on, and it kindles greater wars around it like a spark in dry grass. Regrettable things occur, but I know that the Corrivality is the engine of the world, and it is an honour to play my eternal part in Eternity's sustention.'
