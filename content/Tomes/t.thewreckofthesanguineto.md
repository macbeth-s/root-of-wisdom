# The Wreck of the Sanguineto
A captain's log from the disastrous voyage of the Sanguineto, preserved by the ship's chaplain, Fray Carlos Ginez, CA. 
## I'm Reading...
As they rounded Cape Horn, the crew were beset by "a luxuriance of fungous flesh" which eventually destroyed all but the chaplain.
## I've Read...
The Captain wrote that "our good and quiet chaplain" treated the crew with 'an Ointment Protective to ease the infestation' he crafted using spores. Only Fray Ginez survived the voyage.
