# The Wayfinders' Guide
An introductory manual for initiates to the New Wayfinders, a fledgling society founded in 1931 taking after the legendary Wayfinders of old.

## I've Read...
‘Where the first Wayfinder walked, she left behind roads. Our eyes cannot see them, but if we walk blind, they can lead us to her home of wonders.’
