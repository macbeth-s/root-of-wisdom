# Operations of a Certain Finality
Subtitled 'The Hammer's Sundering'. The work of an anonymous adept who violently despised the Invisible Serapeum, the library of the Watchman's Tree in Alexandria.
## I'm Reading...
The author outlines the means they had taken to sabotage the place and its collection, which increasingly seem more poetic than effective, to the point where the whole business may in fact be some kind of allegory..
## I've Read...
The author gloats that with the techniques of Putrefaction and Calcination, they have transformed the Library's stocks of asimel to 'a seduction of black sapphire' which will ensure the texts therein contain only 'Moon-truths'.
