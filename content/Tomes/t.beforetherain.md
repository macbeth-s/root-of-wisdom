A terrifying poem, supposedly taken from oral traditions of herders in North Africa in the first century. 
## I'm Reading...

## I've Read...
Each verse describes the rain differently. The rain is 'blood from lambs left bleating', the rain is 'the mourner's weeping', the rain is 'the sweat of yearning.'
