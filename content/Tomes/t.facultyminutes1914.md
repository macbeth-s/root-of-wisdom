# Faculty Minutes, 1914
The minutes of a somber meeting of the Haustorium's faculty. 
## I'm Reading...
Sister Oxicantha, the only extant member of the founding faculty, reminisces with the Dottore about her lost colleagues. She regards their deaths and disappearances as avoidable, but understands that as an impossibility beneath this branch of the Watchman's Tree.
## I've Read...
Oxicantha reads aloud Leonel Cipagauta's letter of resignation, who left the Haustorium in mumbling incoherency after delving into its depths. She proposes the use of more stringent methods to test potential future faculty members, 'to distinguish the willing from those who wane.'
