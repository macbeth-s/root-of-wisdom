# Memories for you, My Most Succulent Mistress of Wood-Lore
While researching her colorful guide Exorcism for Girls, a young Thirza Blake briefly braved the dangerous spores of the Haustorium. Berenechea Bee-Eater, then garde manger of L'ostello del Dottore, seems to have become infatuated and wrote her this doting collection.
## I'm Reading...
“I found a succulent wood-remnant which may interest you, Mistress, if I might be of humble service. Your pyrus fruits are delicious but [[here in the presence of nectar aspect, the Sylvan Stories show us how to encourage roots to grow towards the sky]]."
## I've Read...
"I know, Mistress, you must return to your far-off rock. I would plead that in decades upon the unhappy occasion of your passing that you arrange that your executor mail only your beauteous ring finger or other small extremity so that I may taste of your  inimitable memories.” Thirza is said to have replied, in typical hyperbole, that she would sooner turn herself into a tree.
