# The Coils of God
The journal of Zane Marc Gentis, recounting his desolate expedition to the Temple of Seven Coils, once built in the Third History, now present in every History.
## I'm Reading...
‘The site will tolerate no life; not even monsters can withstand its burning shadows. For three days, we sought to pierce its gate, to set our eyes upon its smothered god: the Seven Coils.’
## I've Read...
After his departure, Gentis’ writing grows delirious, and he is convinced his expedition was fated to fail. He despairs over his confinement (containment?) in ‘the coil-convolutions’ of prophecy, and fears his soul will never find rest while the temple is sealed. ‘The Loop never ends.’
