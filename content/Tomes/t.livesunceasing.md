# Lives Unceasing
Delilah Molotla's most poignant work, extolling the resilience and survival of "Indians of all tribes across all Histories."

Initial Location: [[vestibule]]
## I'm Reading...
For centuries, we have faced extermination and yet still we persist. We each and all join Hat√ºey in turning away from Heaven and joining our people in what the colonizers cannot help but see as Hell.'
## I've Read...
This is not an occult text. Our religions are not magic, and our culture is not pagan nonsense. The Invisible World is invisible across hemispheres, and neither colonizers nor Indians have any special right to it.'
