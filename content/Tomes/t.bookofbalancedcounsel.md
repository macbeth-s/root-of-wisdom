# Book of Balanced Counsel
An incongruent version of the Popol Vuh that recounts the defeat of the Lords of Xibalba, rulers of the underworld, at the hands of the Hero Twins Hunahpu and Xbalanque. They have long been known as Names, but no one knows with certainty who they serve.
## I'm Reading...
The Lords of Xibalba summon the Hero Twins, intent on humiliating and killing them. They outwit their deadly tests, then reshape themselves in fire to trick the Lords. Disguised, Xbalanque dismembers then resurrects Hunahpu, while Hunahpu incinerates then remakes their House from ash. The Lords demand to be reshaped and allow the Hero Twins to kill them, erasing their existence from memory to claim Xibalba as their ownâ€¦
## I've Read...
Hesitantly, the author calls them former aspects and now Names of the Meniscate and Madrugad. Without a ruler, they ruled themselves, the designs of sun and moon perfected by their hands. A fraction of their amnesiac power can be drawn from Albedic Essence, but it also suggests that with enough Sky, the arts of Transformations & Liberations can free a 'reflected ink' from liquid.
