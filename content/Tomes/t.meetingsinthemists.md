# Meetings in the Mists
Hei Mao the Traveler documents his encounters with the Nameless Name, the fog-footed servant of the Hour called the Velvet.
## I'm Reading...
‘The Nameless Name is never seen; except, of course, by the very grayest of cats. A set of seven secrets offered to its mists shall be buried and forgotten - but what is buried can always take root and sprout.’
## I've Read...
Mao writes of the nooks frequented by the Nameless Name. Each bears a single candle, upon which secrets may be rendered to garner concealment. He mentions its preference for the Maggephene Mysteries, suggesting their use in worshiping the Velvet, ‘though she is never worshiped,’ he adds.
