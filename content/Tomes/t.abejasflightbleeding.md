# Abeja's Flight: Bleeding
The first of Fatima Abejaâ€™s hagiographies, examining the life of Rosa de Lima, the Thorned Saint. She wrote this in her wandering days while visiting the Convent of Santo Domingo, where she took shelter during her time in La Paz.
## I'm Reading...
As Rosa grew, her beauty flourished. The men of Lima desired her to the point where she cloistered herself in her room to evade them. From time-to-time, she would bring the sick or hungry in and feed them the roses she grew, miraculously allaying their conditions.
## I've Read...
The local Dominicans sought her and she soon joined their order, donning the habit as well as a circlet made of silver needles. Any who touched her found their skin pricked with needles that induced ecstasies. When she died, her face bloomed like a rose, its scent comforting all of Lima.
