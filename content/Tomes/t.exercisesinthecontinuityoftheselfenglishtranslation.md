# Exercises in the Continuity of the Self (English Translation)
Techniques proposed by the Haustorical Mutuality for 'the persistence of memory after the body is discarded'.
## I'm Reading...
The soul-element wist is regarded as 'the fundamental value of the individual'. All other soul-elements, it is implied, may potentially be discarded, as can the individual itself.
## I've Read...
The Mutuality expresses grudging respect for the Hour called Elegiast, 'who calls each of the Dead by name', but also concern over the Elegiast's subtlety when it chooses to inspire particular interpretations of Histories. The Mutuality proposes the use of Nowhere-energies in distracting or discouraging the Elegiast, in order to assure that 'the persistence of History remains unalloyed'.
