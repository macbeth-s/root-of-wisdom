# The Tale of Leonor: Convergence
The first volume chronicling the life of Leonor Curicuillor, the Princess of the Fourfold Realm and Matron of the Loom.
## I'm Reading...
Since her birth, Leonor knew the Twins, knew their desperate desire for union. She sought to love another as the Witch loved the Sister, but found none who could return the same. In despair, she tried to drown in the Vilcanota, hoping to join the mariners of the Painted River. And in so doing, was rescued by her beloved Quilaco.
## I've Read...
Leonor and Quilaco worked to become as one being, but when her father declared war upon his brother, Quilaco’s master, they were forced apart. At the Rock of the Owl, the two met in secret promising to reunite, having shared a vision of a ‘Sanctuary of Roots’ hidden in the mountains. To commemorate this, they spilled their blood upon a thorned chain, and with their knowledge of the Heart-arts, bound themselves with an unbreakable binding.
