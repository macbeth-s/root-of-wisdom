# Escape to Golden Khersonese
A bewildering narrative by Marinus of Rhodes describing his absconsion to the other side of the world.
## I'm Reading...
Marinus clearly does not understand his own uncanny mode of travel at all, yet he endeavors desperately to describe the geography he glimpsed while being 'wrest through air and time as a lace through an ayelet.' 
## I've Read...
Finding himself in Golden Khersonese, Marinus is ordered to entertain a salon of 'Enrobed Sibilants' with a tale of his faraway land. Marinus teaches his summoners a forbidden epic of his people through a series of riddles and parables, which confound and delight them. He is then swiftly hurled back to his home.
