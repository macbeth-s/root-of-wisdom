# Carrion Verse
Candelaria Ponce's final work of poetry, a collection of beautiful pastoral verses and gruesome elegies. 
## I'm Reading...
The poems are loosely connected through the life of a single great condor, who hatches from an egg alone in the Andes, its nest-brothers smashed by careless trappers. The condor comes to take to the skies in some of Ponce's most heartwrenchingly beautiful poetry. 
## I've Read...
The verses dwelling on the condor's feasting on dead hikers and shepherds are grisly and disturbing. Ponce shifts from portraying the condor as a noble creature of splendor and majesty to dwelling on its reliance on death to subsist as 'a ragged king of the sky.'
