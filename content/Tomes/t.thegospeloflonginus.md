# The Gospel of Longinus
An extracanonical account on the death of the Thorn-Crowned Son oft attributed to the Unnumbered Legate who attended his final moments.
## I'm Reading...
‘What is lost without shall be found within; so into the Earth I commend my Blood.’
## I've Read...
At Noon, darkness falls upon the world; the land stirs at the taste of Blood; the Thorn-Crowned Son echoes the scream of Sea and Sky and Stone. As he breathes his last, the Legate’s sight is ‘silvered,’ and he witnesses the shadowed, silent pulse of the Moon.
