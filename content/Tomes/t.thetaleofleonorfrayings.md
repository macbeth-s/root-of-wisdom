Leonor swore to share certain secrets of immortality on the day she wedded her lover, and Alfonso, at the behest of his chaplain, acquiesced to her conditions. For a year, this uneasy peace persisted, until the conquistador’s patience dried up and he forced Leonor to wed him. Before  their vows could be completed, the two fell, or jumped, from the Ruins’ prominence into the valley below. Her most ardent followers insisted this to be, in some sense, the final fulfillment of her promises.
