# The Geminiad iii
A fragile manuscript, illuminated with twinned shapes of sad and luminous beauty, and with all the phases of the moon. It might be as old as the seventh century, but the language - Fucine - is much older. Coral decorates its cover, and its page-edges are sharp enough to slash a throat.
## I'm Reading...
These pages outline the nature, and the doctrines, of an Hour that demands the union of what has been separated, an Hour that is sought at the water's edge and beneath the moon: the Witch-and-Sister. The language is allusive, enigmatic, intricate. It'll take some untangling.
## I've Read...
The third volume of the Geminiad reminds us that the Witch-and-Sister has been known to manifest as the Sister-and-Witch - and that this face may heal, while the other face is always hungry. It implies connections between the Witch-and-Sister and the Hours of the Wood - especially the secret-keeper called the Velvet - but it is ambiguous on whether the Witch-and-Sister is a Wood-hour proper. And it speaks at length about the sadness of the two-who-are-one, the sadness that remains from their time as flesh.
