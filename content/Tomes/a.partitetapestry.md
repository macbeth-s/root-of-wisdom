# Partite Tapestry
Candelaria Ponce said this tapestry 'is useless, for it showed only that which was yet to come and none of what was.'

Initial Location: [[tapestryroom|Tapestry Room]]
## I'm Reading...
The Weaver would have worked centuries before the rise of the Four Quarters or the Intercalate, yet both seem to be depicted here.	
## I've Read...
Tawantinsuyu, the Solar Hours... the layered fibers suggest a parallel, a recursiveness, to these stories of union and disunion, of the Universal Monarchs' and the Sun-in-Splendour's graspings for Eternity. What was united will be divided, what was divided will be outshone... the tapestry's fringe has been sealed with beeswax.
