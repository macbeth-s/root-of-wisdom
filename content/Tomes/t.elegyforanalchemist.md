# Elegy for an Alchemist
An anonymous obituary published widely in Noon when news spread of Ursula Sabès' disappearance at sea. Apparently, Robigo was known to tease Bengui that she had been the anonymous author.

Subtitled 'Forgotten or Devoured? A Choice,' the elegy is curt (even uncomfortable) in its praise. The author is clearly not used to vulnerability. They make extremely clear nonetheless that none could match Sabès in art or in knowledge, and that none ever would.

The eulogist then turns to a great many vicious warnings. 'The late alchemist saw being forgotten as the worst punishment one could face, yet she fell to those who desired nothing more than obscurity. Neither birds nor worms are safe from claws and talons, and the great many of us who know how to direct them may find their justice.'
