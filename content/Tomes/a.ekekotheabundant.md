# 'Ekeko the Abundant'
A clay Aymara idol venerated as a figure of prosperity by the Curicuillorians, and unexpectedly, certain members of the Colegio throughout the Mutuality Era.<br>Initial Location: [[fourfoldsacrarium|Fourfold Sacrarium]]

After Bahamonde facilitated the covenant, he decreed this idol be removed ‘in recognition of our Host.’ While the Curicuillorians acquiesced, they insisted it remain upon the premises as an honored guest, fearful of consequences were it ignored entirely, a tradition upheld until the sudden quiescence of the last friar, Guillermo Alcaraz, in 1817.
