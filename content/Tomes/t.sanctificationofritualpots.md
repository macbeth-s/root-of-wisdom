# Sanctification of Ritual Pots
The Hushery-practitioner Paul Siromskiy outlines the materials and methods required to craft vessels capable of containing delinquent Mansus-spirits, and other entities beside. 
## I'm Reading...
A stringent member of the Obliviates, Siromskiy was ruthless to those who would defy the Three Chains, the sacrosanct oaths passed down from their successors. Here is detailed a vessel to deprive its prisoner of all sensation, ‘for the reprobates of the Grail.’
## I've Read...
Siromskiy presents a number of proposals for subduing the Forge’s ‘delinquent dross.’ Particularly unnerving is the Snuff, in which the victim is deprived of ‘the fuels of the soul’ until they are reduced to a form ‘lesser than smothered cinders.’
