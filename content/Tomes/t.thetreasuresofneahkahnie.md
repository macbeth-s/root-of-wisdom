# The Treasures of Neahkahnie
After his people were removed to a reservation, Chief Kilchis of the Tillamook wrote this, an account of his ancestry purportedly containing truths behind the treasure of Neahkahnie Mountain.

His blacksmith ancestor survived the wreckage of a ship from the Galeón de Acapulco. The tribe took him in, healed by a woman of the Nehalem. He in turn informed her of the cargo the ship carried - beeswax. This caught her affection and the two soon married, sharing 'secrets of renewal and remaking.'

Using her 'protective salve,' they transformed it into a 'forbidden sacrament' using Fermentation and Sustentation techniques. He credits this treasure, alongside the beeswax, with aiding his people’s survival as settlers and smallpox converged on their lands. 'Dangers cannot be destroyed,' Kilchis notes, 'but they can be outlasted.'
