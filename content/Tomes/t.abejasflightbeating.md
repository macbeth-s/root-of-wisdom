# Abeja's Flight: Beating
The third of Fatima Abeja’s hagiographies, examining the life of Juan Macias, the Ostiary Saint. When performing her song Volveremos, stinging sap oozed from the Convent’s azulejos and ceilings. The friars barred her from the premises afterwards.
## I'm Reading...
Juan trained as a shepherd for his uncle’s flock, ever-watchful with the words that walk spilling from his lips. When he joined the Dominican Priory in Lima, he spent his days watching at its gates where many citizens sought his counsel. No weather nor sickness could drive him away.
## I've Read...
Juan sent his donkey through the city’s streets, its joyful brayings drawing the rich and poor alike in exuberance to the gates where he kept his vigil. When he died, the city mourned, and the sky wept; but on the stormiest days, his voice is heard in thunder. Those who echo his words are visited by his spirit, invited to dance with him beyond the clouds, upon the skies.
