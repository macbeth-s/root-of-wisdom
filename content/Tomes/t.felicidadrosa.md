# Felicidad Rosa
A duet for guitar and guitarr√≥n, composed by a younger and bolder Enrique Esquivel for his thesis at the University of San Marcos.
## I'm Reading...
Each chord plucks at the heart, harmonized dissonance drawing out soft joys and sorrows which bloom in the silence between. Esquivel and his partner wind their melodies through the body.

Esquivel never revealed who he performed this with, but faint woody creaks and groans call to mind the half-dead creatures known as the Burgeoning Risen. Such a mundane use for a spirit is questionable, but perhaps he meant to prove himself to authorities beyond the scope of academia.
