# Cave-Echoes
Leonel Cipagauta spent time recording drips of water and the noises of bats in the caves beneath the Haustorium, then layered over them with an original composition.
## I'm Reading...
Immense patience is required to sit through the recording. One begins to go mad just from the sheer volume of <i>plunks</i> and <i>plinks</i> that seemed to so invest Cipagauta, at various dynamics.
## I've Read...
The last seconds are worth the wait. Before the recording ends, there is a noise like glass being poured from a spout, or ice being forced into a helix, and Cipagauta mutters, clearly afraid, 'If I am the sixth, then the seventh will taste the blood...'
