# To Travel Ever Onwards
The Wayfinders rarely bothered to set down maps to their pilgrimage sites, preferring instead to pass their routes down through oral tradition. This tale, recounted by Don Óscar Zavala, was supposedly the means by which he first reached the Haustorium.
## I'm Reading...
The tale describes journeys through ‘the Road of the Eagles’ and ‘the Flame’s Valley.’ Marginal notes (from Zavala?) suggest these directions may serve as allegorical instructions for synthesizing certain Inks of Power, noting them as pathways only known in separate Histories.
## I've Read...
‘The Sun’s Auroral Ichor will reveal the Ink Melancholy in the presence of sufficient Rose. These same techniques, augmented with Forge, can produce the Ink of Joys with the Essence of the Forge.’
