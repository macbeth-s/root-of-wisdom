# War-Songs of the Dragonslayers
Ancient oral traditions of heroic valor, maintained through the screeching of eagles and the scratching of knives.
## I'm Reading...
The dragonslayers sing with immense admiration for their quarry, rousing themselves with strong drink and invoking the proper sacrifices before venturing into the mountains.
## I've Read...
Time and time again, the songs return to the motif of the slain--it is always unclear whether the slain is man or dragon--being lain upon a mountaintop at the base of a Que√±ua tree. With each felling, a notch is made on the trunk of the tree and the trunk of the victor.
