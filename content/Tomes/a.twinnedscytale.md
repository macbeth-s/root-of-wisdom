## I'm Studying...
One is carved from queñua, the paper tree, the other from olive. They are carved by the same hand, and the leather strips from the same skin.
## I've Studied...
Both rods were excavated from Zakros twenty years ago, and dated to 1500 BC. Queñua could not have been in Europe then.
