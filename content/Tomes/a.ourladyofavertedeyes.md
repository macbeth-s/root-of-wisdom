# Our Lady of Averted Eyes
A famous 'weeping statue' from a small church in La Paz, reported to have cried blood following the 1840 Earthquake.

Initial Location: [[historicalexhibit]]
## I'm Studying...
The statue is carved from one solid piece of a hard and heavy stone, but nonetheless seems to indeed be porous around Our Lady's eyes.
## I've Studied...
The material streaked down her face is not mortal blood, but it is a kind of golden ichor, like the blood of the Carapace Cross. In the presence of signifcant scale-aspect, it seems that the blood of the Cross can once again flow from stone.
