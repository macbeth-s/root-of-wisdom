# The Liberator at Evening
Fabiola Toral's memoir of her time as the Liberator's lover during his four-year exile in the Evening Isles.
## I'm Reading...
The Liberator spent most of his time in Port-au-Prince, where he befriended the alchemist Ursula Sabès and spent many a long night debating the merits of change or stability, fame or tranquility, and eternity or history.
## I've Read...
As he left the island called Noon a man of a quieter temperant and hardened scars, the Liberator suggested to Sabès that she find a way to synthesize the 'potent waters of that Spring, so that those who wish to pass into obscurity in their own country may do so.'
