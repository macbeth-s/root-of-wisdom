# Squash Them!
A zealous invocation to war against the Worms of a Scale, which led to the formation of vicious mobs in both Rio de Janeiro and Montevideo in the Third History.
## I'm Reading...
The authors are certainly of that Long-faction known as Birds of a Feather, or Aves Eternas in Latin America, and their fondness for many liberal governments is obvious. 
## I've Read...
The Birds warn against the 'primitive writhing-arts' of the Worm cabals they identify in some major cities, who seem to have formed urban guerrillas. The Worms are accused of turning 'small victories; single winning moves' into 'fervent and delusional sacrifices to profane forces, right beneath the nose of our right and enlightened leaders!'
