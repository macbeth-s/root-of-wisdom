# The Blood of Histories and the Roads of Stone
An investigation of forbidden ink-lore by the symurgist Libreng Ibon.
## I'm Reading...
Ibon suggests that the inks the Histories are written in are, in truth, the blood of the gods-who-were-stone. He postulates that their deaths were either the key to or the cause of the creation of the Histories.

As with lives and days, roads are only complete when they end. So History is a road upon which we can only travel backwards, so that its end is its beginning and its beginning is its end. But roads can always be walked both ways, even when one direction is forbidden.' Ibon concludes his point by emphasizing that Ichor Lernaean, the blood of stone, can be contained and chilled into the encastum nillycant.
