Lavinia Stone, the cubist painter, quoted this at the unveiling of her Constellation Suite, after which a meteorite crushed her.
## I'm Reading...
The Sutra meditates on the nature of Stars resting at the far ends of the sky. It observes that though their light is visible, it does not mean the Star which cast it still exists, likening the glimmers to echoes of long-dead voices.

‘Together, each History is dissonance. Align their Sights beneath the same Sky, corded by the instruments of Time, and let their Harmony herald the ascent of those below, the descent of those above.’
