# Eternity, the Uprooting
A chillingly lucid description of the relationship between Eternity and History by the symurgist Libreng Ibon. 
## I'm Reading...
Those who desire Eternity oft describe it as Light, but Eternity is more a flower, History the earth it is rooted in. Were it pulled from the ground, it will inevitably die. So Eternity cannot live without History's existence, but it might yet bloom.
## I've Read...
A blooming flower longs to bear the fruit by which it spreads seeds, but the beauty can lead it to be plucked prematurely. So the stem grows thorny and the flesh bitter, teaching by the truth of pain. But if we set these truths into word, these teachings can be made softer.
