# Abeja's Flight: Beginning
The fifth and last of Fatima Abeja’s hagiographies, examining the life of Saint Catherine of the Shattered Wheel. Her pilgrimage to Dayr al-Qiddīsa Katrīn, which she calls the zeroth Library of the Watchman’s Tree, ended with the original copy of this work added to their collection.
## I'm Reading...
When Maxentius ordered Catherine’s execution by breaking wheel, it immediately shattered at her touch. The Moth and the Red Grail both claim her their own, as her hair continued growing after her beheading and life-giving blood flowed out from her neck, but Abeja says otherwise…
## I've Read...
Catherine’s body is fiercely guarded by the monks. Abeja gains permission to examine it after revealing her 'flowering heritage' and discovers the liquid to be Nectar. When she drinks it, she envisions a 'will of stone sealed in secrets,' to be revealed through the Rites of the Roots.
