# Faculty Minutes, 1848
The minutes of a tense political meeting of the Haustorium's faculty. 
## I'm Reading...
Ursula Sabès was to be sworn into the faculty this meeting. In her absence, the remaining members speculate over her fate, suspecting the involvement of the Obliviates, with whom she oft consorted.
## I've Read...
Kume Tsūten and Nacèra Bengui debate on what would motivate Port Noon to move against Sabès. Tsūten believes the Worms saw her unprecedented genius as a threat. Bengui disptues this, claiming her intimate knowledge of the lesser Histories instead undermined the mission of the Birds. The meeting ends as the other attendees leave the two to argue.
