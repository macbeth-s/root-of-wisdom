# The Amber Sutra
The neurologist Dolen Van Leer studied this sutra before setting off into the Altai Mountains. His descendants continue to search for him.
## I'm Reading...
The Sutra describes, in oblique terms, the realms of the Land of the River over which the Great Hooded Princes rule. It speaks glowingly of their ‘jewel-starred caverns’ and ‘song-scented springs.’
## I've Read...
Among them is Dvaraka, a city of immense and impossible beauty, and it speaks of its inevitable consumption by the half-real half-brother of the Princes. But until his arrival, the bells will ring their song of seductions from the spired temples of ice.
