# DEP, QED
Wilwardo Castillo Knox's final manuscript, unfinished and near-unintelligible. 
## I'm Reading...
Increasingly self-isolating after a brush with death in the Skolex Menagerie, Castillo Knox writes convoluted and nonsensical geometric proofs of childish topics like mobius strips and immovable objects. 
## I've Read...
The final proof concerns itself with an abstraction so intense it seems to lift off the page. Nothing is truly proven, but much is imagined through Castillo Knox's ascendant journey towards the stars. QED.
