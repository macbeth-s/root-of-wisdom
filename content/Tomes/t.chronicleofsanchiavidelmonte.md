# Chronicle of San Chiavi del Monte
A 15th century chronicle meant to legitimaze the line of the Universal Monarchs, but which ended up being used to descredit them during the War of the Roads. 
## I'm Reading...
The Queen's maternal blood, it becomes immediately clear, goes but two generations back to Lancaster and the Plantagenet line. The King, meanwhile, was said to have inherited 'ostrum-eyes' from his father, which swiftly develop into severe cataracts. 
## I've Read...
In discussion of the Monarchs' union, the cronista grows conspiratorial, accusing the well-respected Abruzzese Contessa Cecilia of financing the forgery of a bull to secure special dispensation against consanguinity. 'The protections against blood and burning have been evaded, and only a great reshaping may follow,' the cronista warns.
