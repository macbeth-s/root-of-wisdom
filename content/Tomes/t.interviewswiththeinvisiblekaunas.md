# Interviews with the Invisible: Kaunas
An interview with a newly-kindled Edge-long - who the journalist Amadea Franco purported to have met through the 1925 Reckoner War.
## I'm Reading...
Though the Reckoner War could have facilitated an Edge-ascendance, no account of a dyad emerging from that period exists. Unless they kept quiet (and very few dyads ever do), the journalist - or whatever the author is - likely fabricated this Long; but recorded here are the Cinnabar Forms - that is, the fiercer onslaughts of the Wolf-Divided.
## I've Read...
Think of the Corrivality as a fire. It warms, and then it burns. So my Foe and I warm the world around us, and then eventually it burns. But we're a wandering fire. So the world burns not in one place, but many. And we're not alone. There are other wandering flames. And another thing a fire does: it spreads, as long as it finds fuel. The world is our fuel. One day, then, sooner than you think, the world will be all aflame. And a final function of fire: if you've ever cooked meat, you'll know it brings out the juices. So when the flame burns down, the Wolf and all the wandering flames will feast. My mouth is watering already.'
