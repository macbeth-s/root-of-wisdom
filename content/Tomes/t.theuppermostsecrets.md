# The Uppermost Secrets
The seer-scholar L. K. Vögel once attracted the attention of an American contingent of Lantern-long who titled themselves the Company of Lights. Earning their graces, he extracted information about this ephemeral class of immortals to write this text.
## I'm Reading...
These Lantern-long, termed fulgents by Vögel, reside entirely in the Mansus as a result of their ascension. Despite this, their skill at shaping dreams and directing them through the Bounds allows them to influence the Wake in subtle yet far-reaching ways.
## I've Read...
Conspiratorially, Vögel betrays the different uses of a fulgent’s dream. A mortal may be ensnared into their service; it may reveal lesser ways in the Mansus; and curiously, a kind of Lure - Allure? - may be grown from it. This last is necessary to become a Name of the Watchman, but must be planted in ‘the shade of a shade,’ lest Calyptra glimpse its glare and uproot it.
