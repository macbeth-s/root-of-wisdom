# Nocturnal Wards
Notes written by Misiyana, called ‘Martina la Maga’ by the Spaniards, documenting the incorporation of ink into her traditional rites of warding.
## I'm Reading...
Misiyana descended from a long line of adepts well-versed in Preservation to protect the Fourfold Realm. She passed many techniques to the Curicuillorians, but it appears she kept secrets even from them.
## I've Read...
She outlines how the arts of Containment can transmute a pigment or drink into the ‘Water of the White’ and the ‘Water of the Wheel’ respectively. This only occurs in the presence of sufficient Moon or Nectar-aspect, but she hints how these can give way to the ‘Water which is Blood.’
