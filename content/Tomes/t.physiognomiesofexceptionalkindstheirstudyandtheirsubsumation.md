# Physiognomies of Exceptional Kinds, their Study, and their Subsumation
Dr. Louize Haig attributes her occult awakening to accidentally stumbling upon this "medical" text in a forgotten bookshop in New Haven. 
## I'm Reading...
Pages upon pages of nonsense phrenology mixed with sound medicine plagiarized from reputable textbooks. Tucked among the drivel are measurements for unknown species like <i>homo cruces var. bombus </i> which the book notes have a higher capacity for spatial reasoning than 'most races.'
## I've Read...
The book describes few methods that have any bearing on any medicine, though it does suggest 'perfection of an older form' can be achieved through shockingly simple operations on an average hen's egg.
