# Marcelan Analects
Isidoro Dahlmann's literary and philosophical reflections on poetry, pastoralism, and 'lost songs of the open sky.'
## I'm Reading...
Dahlmann writes of those who sang 'that old lost music' with something that is not quite nostalgia. He tells a related anecdote of his first time attending the symphony after being struck blind. 
## I've Read...
My dear friend Cipagauta, who is no longer near, told me that if I wished to hear that music I would have to meet the only one of the Thirty left to sing it. He told me that it would be in vain, for her eyes are open wide still and she wishes only to see and not to hear.'
