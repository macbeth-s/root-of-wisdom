# On Horonomastics
The mask maker and horomachist Sülz, colloquially dubbed ‘the Onomast,’ produced this work exploring the place and purpose of the servants of the Hours called Names.
## I'm Reading...
‘Names, as aspects of their Hours, are fundamentally controlled by them; yet the divided attentions of the Hours mean certain actions of their servants may go unnoticed, just as we lose track of our breath. But as with breath, a Name’s absence is quickly noticed.’
## I've Read...
Sülz divides Names into two groups: Emanations and Ascendants. The former are specialized archetypes of the Hour from which they emerge, deepening their powers in their given domain. In contrast, Ascendants come to embody an Hour’s nature, and in winning their attention, enter into their service; however, it avers that not all who ascend do so of their own volition.
