# The Smoke Sutra
Previously owned by the firefighter Finn Gillian before his death in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. No one has ever cleared the soot from its parchment.
## I'm Reading...
The Smoke Sutra dedicates itself to the ashen soot which drifts from the Maw Wrought, otherwise known as the Malleary, and the deceptive smoke-spirits which arise from it.
## I've Read...
‘Fire renders truth and lies to ash, and in this way, they are made equals. If smoke is the tongue of flame, let its kiss fall upon you; what smolders yet still burns.’
