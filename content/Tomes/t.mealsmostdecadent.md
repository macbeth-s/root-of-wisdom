# Meals Most Decadent
Berenechea Bee-Eater writes gleefully of the dinner parties he hosted at the Haustorium in the aftermath of the 1840 earthquake.
## I'm Reading...
It becomes increasingly clear that Berenechea picked over the remains of the Haustorical Mutuality and the few other victims of the earthquake, incorporating their remnants into his many extravagant dishes.
## I've Read...
The menu includes Sacrament Hyphalite, apparently a favorite drink of the Haustorical Mutuality (made from Protector's Salve with Moth-influence) alongisde other extreme offerings such as rubywise ruin and chicha bullido. A guest list provided at the end includes "Bitru, 4th Thirstly," "General Saulo Hamamura da Cunha," Srta. Howard," and finally "Robigo, a retired Protector."
