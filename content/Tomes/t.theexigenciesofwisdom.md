# The Exigencies of Wisdom
Don Ã“scar Zavala's final work, and a complete rejection of everything he had written before. 
## I'm Reading...
Zavala viciously attacks the class of people called Know by creating a distinction between the Know and the Wise. 
## I've Read...
The Wise, he argues, 'seek not power, seek not knowledge, seek not answers to questions,' and instead 'seek safety, seek comfort, seek friendship and a stiff drink at the end of a long day's labors.' He regrets bitterly that he cannot count himself among the Wise.
