# Hand of Barbara the Spark
An incorruptible relic of St Barbara the Spark, patron of prisoners and ithasts. The palm is charred and continually radiates a soft warmth.<br>Initial Location: [[reliquary|Reliquary]]
## I'm Studying...
During the War of the Roads, the Sovereigns of the Leashed Flame enshrined her across the Continent, though they generally referred to her as St Spark. Perhaps this was an unwise choice. Her miracles include the freeing of prisoners, and the Sovereigns’ Flame was infamously <i>un</i>leashed by the end of the War.
## I've Studied...
Seared upon this are signs of a carcass spark - radiant motes considered to be fragmented hearts of Stars, or even remnants of the divided Sun. The spark itself is gone, likely lost long before this entered the Colegio’s reliquary. But heat such as this continues to cool long after the flame is extinguished.
