# The Ballad of Biedde
Verse from Mago of Gadès, detailing the exploits of Biedde, Scourge of Ways.
## I'm Reading...
‘Upon the Ponts Jumeaux he struck his mark. The blade was swift to break the skin apart. New blood now flowed, Biedde’s sweet wealth secured. Then fast he fled, his victim quick-sutured.’
## I've Read...
‘All blood can be replenished; Time cannot. What’s lost from vein or road returns when caught. Grieve not the scar which rises in its place, for there, the lessons learned can be retraced.’
