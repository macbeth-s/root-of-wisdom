# Espadas de Hojas y Raíces
Obscure horticultural traditions practiced across South America, from the Andean peaks to the Amazonian basin, as documented by the conquistador Alfonso de Soraluce.
## I'm Reading...
De Soraluce spent inordinate amounts of his wealth in pursuit of a rumored stone-softening method practiced in the Realm of Four Parts. While he failed to discover it, his efforts gave rise to the unique gardening techniques practiced throughout the Haustorium’s lifetime.
## I've Read...
Although the rumor De Soraluce believed in is most likely false, some of his suppositions are surprisingly elucidating. He singles out the arts of Leaves and Thorns as effective for rendering petrified materials to their previous form, but only in conjunction with a ‘potency of History’ derived from techniques he claims are being concealed by ‘those disreputable Indians.’
