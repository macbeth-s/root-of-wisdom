# Interviews with the Invisible: Busayya
An interview with a newly-wrought Edge-long, who ascended as a result of the 1925 Reckoner War - at least, according to its interviewer, the journalist Amadea Franco.
## I'm Reading...
There are no known records of an ascendant Edge-dyad resulting from the Reckoner War. In all likelihood, the journalist (or whoever authored this) used it as a framing device for their own fiction; but outlined here are the Brass Forms - that is, the greater techniques of the Lionsmith.
## I've Read...
If I'd known how much fun it is being an Edge dyad, I'd have started causing trouble long ago. It hurts sometimes, of course, but that's battle, and the opposite of battle is death. And I always heal without scars. Wherever my Foe and I go, war follows, and we're stronger every day. It's glorious. One day, perhaps, I might somehow still kill him, or he'll kill me, and then we'll both be dead. I think about that sometimes. I still hate him, though it's a familiar and warming flame, and that means I'd like him to die, even if I go down too. But if that ever happens, there'll be a lot of blood under the bridge first.'
