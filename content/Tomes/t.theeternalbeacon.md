# The Eternal Beacon
Henri de Miffonis elaborates the theoretical construction of a machine he calls the Periodoscope.
## I'm Reading...
Eternity is endless, but to be without end means it cannot begin. Then it must be that Eternity is already here, hidden beneath History. If it is, then I can draw out a new pattern with the right steps.’
## I've Read...
