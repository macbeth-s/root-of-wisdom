# My Guilt, My Wounds, My Misdeeds, and My Deserved Punishment
A tortured confessional from the Obliviate Paul Siromsky, authored before his quiet disappearance.
## I'm Reading...
Siromskiy’s tone is harried, writing in scratchy half-fragments about his ‘reprehensible Betrayal.’ It’s impossible to clearly understand what this Betrayal was, but it evidently involved flowers, shadows, and a figure he only calls C.
## I've Read...
Siromskiy planned to exile himself to the southernmost part of the world and wait for his end. Before he leaves, he resolves to shroud his act in ‘a cinnabar haze’ as to prevent its recurrence; even so, he despairs that such an attempt is ultimately futile, concluding that ‘though pain fades, it never dies.’
