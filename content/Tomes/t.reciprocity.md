# Reciprocity
Wilwardo Castillo Knox’s mathematical exploration of humanity’s relationship with the Law and the Hours, whom he calls Numbers.
## I'm Reading...
‘The Moth is zero, before all Numbers. The Watchman is the first all Numbers follow. It is said most humans lie between them. If that is true, then we are neither emptiness nor substance.’
## I've Read...
