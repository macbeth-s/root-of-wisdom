# The Inexhaustible Sutra
The hermetic playwright Ashton Br√§uner often had his characters refer to this, though it remains unclear if he ever read it himself.
## I'm Reading...
The Inexhaustible Sutra speaks of the Mansus and its many ever-ascending stairs. It says each step is composed of time - days or weeks or months - and hints on how their formations may predict the future.
## I've Read...
Ominously, it mentions how Nowhere has stairs of its own. Though the Hours which dwell there are not typically recognized, they nonetheless possess their own spans of time - and it worries that they could still claim even more.
