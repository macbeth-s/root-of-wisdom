# Oculus Invictus
The Blue Liturgist’s phostological work clarifying the Watchman’s place in the doctrines of the Solar Church, and progenitor of the Celian Prayer.
## I'm Reading...
The Names of the Sun ascended or fractured after his Division. Only Sunset Celia retained her status after the Watchman took her into his hand. This shift in allegiance distressed the theologians of the Church, already burdened reconciling the Solar Hours with existing canon.
## I've Read...
‘The Door-in-the-Eye is not Sunset Celia’s master, but her shelter. She bears the flame of Splendour; while she walks behind him, it endures in his lantern. He is the beacon for the Sun’s lost light, and when they are whole once more, he will be the first to see the Second Dawn.’
