# The Banes of Malediction
A grimoire on the raising and dispelling of curses, authored by Almudena Shuña, the last of the Curicuillorians.
## I'm Reading...
‘Curses are not created so much as they are called forth. In the ereb, the shadow-hollow of the soul, they lie in wait as serpents, but the song of the chor may yet entreat them to slumber.’
## I've Read...
Shuña draws provoking comparisons between the dart-magics of the Amazonian shamans and the curses placed upon books in Europe by chary scribes. She includes a number of invocations first used by the Curicuillorians during the War of Two Brothers, and later wielded against the conquistadors.
