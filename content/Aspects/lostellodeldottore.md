# L'Ostello del Dottore
After the earthquake in 1840, Dottore Robigo began working to earn the title "Generous of Hosts" by converting several rooms of the Haustorium into a kind of Adept's hostel. He takes credit for many of these comforts, which are often jarring for visitors who expected an unfriendlier welcome.
