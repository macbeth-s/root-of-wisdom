# Noble Retreat
This was built to be a place of rest and retreat for a victorious conqueror to watch a new dawn over their realm. No conqueror has yet been able to enjoy that sight, but that has not stopped each new generation of inhabitants since Leonor Curicuillor from refurbishing the wing with the height of modern comfort.
