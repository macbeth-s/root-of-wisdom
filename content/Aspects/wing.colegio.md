# Colegio de Santa Potenciana
After Leonor Curricuillor's death, a friar of the Company Anchorite invited his brothers to journey to the Andes from their missions across the world. This wing was renovated as the short-lived Colegio de Santa Potenciana, a place of occult and religious learning. It was soon consumed by rot and by the end of the seventeenth century, not even the Anchorites referred to the Colegio by its official name, instead using the more ominous epithet "the Haustorium."
