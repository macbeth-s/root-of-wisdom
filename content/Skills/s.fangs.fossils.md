## Commit to Bosk
### Linings
The Law cannot protect those outside it. All Alukites know this, so they protect themselves with what was not taken from them, teeth and claw and skin all sharpened. Even the cruelest changes leave comforts for the cunning. That is Bosk’s lesson.<br>
**Effect:** Health
## Commit to Skolekosophy
### Unwindings
The Law cannot protect those outside it. All Worms know this, so they tear at the wounds in the world’s skin, pasts and people and presents bleeding through. Even the most distant dangers claim everything from the unwary. That is Skolekosophy’s lesson.<br>
**Effect:** Shapt
