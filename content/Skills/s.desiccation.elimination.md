## Commit to Hushery
### In the Pale
The students of silence say that Eternity is buried in snow. When everything is one, it will come, so let the stillness without within. Nothing lasts forever.
**Effect:** Trist
## Commit to Illumination
### In the Glare
The students of light say that Eternity is bleached in sunlight. When everything is one, it will come, so let the brightness within without. Everything always is.
**Effect:** Phost
