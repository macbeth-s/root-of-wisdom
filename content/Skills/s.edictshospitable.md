## Commit to Bosk
### A Meeting in the Roots
Most know that the Name Robigo persists through proliferation, spreading his influence through soft hospitality. But he also holds within his master's bounteous self the old secrets of Bosk, where roots drink blood like arteries and the Histories gorge themselves like corpulent worms. <br>
**Effect:** Ereb
## Commit to Ithastry
### A Meeting in the Branches
Most know that the Name Aunt Mopsy protects by proverb, contorting secrets too dangerous to be known through maddening designs. But it is through Ithastry's craft that she brought her mistress to the Yew's embrace, and by those same crafts that she let some spying bird enjoy his voyeuristic pleasures.<br>
**Effect:** Phost
