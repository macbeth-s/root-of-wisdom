## Commit to Hushery
### The Surrender
When the last god-from-stone laid down her blades, she stopped her war of vengeance. If she slew her enemies then, the last remnants of her siblings would die with them. Hushery knows: all destruction brings loss.<br>
**Effect:** Wist
## Commit to Ithastry
### The Stoking
When the last-god-from-stone laid down her blades, she suspended her war of vengeance. If she slew her enemies then, the force of her deepening hatred would die with them. Ithastry knows: all destruction brings potential.<br>
**Effect:** Phost
