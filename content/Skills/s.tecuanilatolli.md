### The Scribe's Tale
There is a very old story known to scribes, about the first of their number. A great force conquered his homeland, utterly destroying it. The scribe fled to the highest peak carrying his dying master who, before he passed, gave one final command. Dutifully, he used his amber blood as ink, setting bright words upon his skin to make a brilliant codex. When the conquerors beheld it, they attempted to make one greater. But the scribe’s would always be the first.

### The Astronomer's Tale
There is a very old story known to astronomers, about the first of their number. A great star appeared over his homeland, sought by all who saw it. The astronomer attempted to chart a path to it on bark but always lacked the space to complete it. So he sought a beast with healing skin and flayed it, completing his map on its ever-growing hide and following it to the star. Others who saw him attempted to create one greater. But the astronomer’s would always be the first.
