## Commit to Ithastry
### Why We Remain
All that begins requires an ending. The Madrugad understands this, as did the Sun-in-Splendour. Since his division, she balances all lives with death, but she does not mandate their length. Until we are ended, we are necessary, so let our actions earn a place for us in the future. This is Ithastry.
**Effect:** Wist
## Commit to Horomachistry
### Why We Rebel
All that ends requires a beginning. The Lionsmith understands this, as does the Colonel. Since his betrayal, he brings destruction to all that was, but he does not prevent new creations. Until we are destroyed, we are free, so let our actions shape our own paths into the future. This is Horomachistry.
**Effect:** Fet
