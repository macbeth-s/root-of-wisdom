### Somewhere
The gods-from-Nowhere are not real, but there are ways they can be. If they left the world, all who traveled with them would walk until they were made real. So the denizens below are always preparing to walk the paths out of Nowhere. This is a matter of Nyctodromy.<br>
**Effect:** Fet

### Nowhere
The gods-from-Nowhere are not real, and the oldest Hours ensure that. If they left the world, all who remained would unravel until they were fully unmade. So the denizens above are always watching to drive back all those born of Nowhere. This is a matter of Horomachistry.<br>
**Effect:** Mettle
