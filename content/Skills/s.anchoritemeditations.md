## Commit to Nyctodromy
### A Crime
The Law binds us all. Are we trapped within it? The Hours know another way, one which would free them from its confines. The Crow would delight and the Moon lament, but both acknowledge that paths forbidden to them can always be traveled. This is Nyctodromy's most perilous teaching.<br>
**Effect:** Shapt
## Commit to Horomachistry
### A Claim
The Law binds us all. Are we trapped within it? Humanity knows another way, one which would broaden its mandated borders. The Key would rejoice and the Axe resent, but both acknowledge that powers forbidden to us can always be taken. This is Horomachistry's most mortal teaching.<br>
**Effect:** Mettle
