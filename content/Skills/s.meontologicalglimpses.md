### The Repurposed Thread
Symurgists know the Histories are woven from threads spun in the Wake, their worth measured with Glory and cut for use by the Hours. When these threads attempt to supersede the pattern, they are pulled out and discarded, but their ambitions do not end. One below the world claims them to build her web, and once it is finished, they shall help her capture those who fly above.
**Effect:** Chor

### The Reach of the Dead
Skolekosophists know the dead are drawn to the Mansus to be tested upon its convolutions, proving they are worthy to serve the Hours. Not all dead succeed, but not all Hours reside in the House. One below the world enjoins them to accept him and his joy, to act as his limbs and as him in the Wood; and once he can freely move, they shall help him invade the spaces above.
**Effect:** Shapt
