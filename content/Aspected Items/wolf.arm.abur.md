# Arm of the Wolf: Abur Fever-Fang
An infectious arm of the Wolf: Abur Fever-Fang, pariah-plague, hate-hound. According to the Church, Abur did not exist before the Intercalate, but the LÃ©gion du Seuil claim he was a Long of the Sun-in-Splendor, granted his weapons to defend the throne. He trained the Legion to assist him until the Sun's division sundered his mind. Now he teaches the jagged arts of vengeance to his outcast victims, so they too can spread the Wolf's agony.
