# 'Coronazo'
Above the House of the Sun lies the merciless Light known as the Glory. It is a pinnacle, a source, a destination. No mortal mind can bear its full might and live to wake. But once woven here was its image, caught in silk and wool, before a mind broken by revelation took a hand to the weave. What remains in these broken braids, these stranded strings, is the fragmented reflection of an inevitable future, of unbroken crowns, of the World Below crushed by Those Above.
Initial Location: [[Spidery Ascent]]
## Consider
Think not the struggle that draws near
Too terrible for man, nor fear
To meet the foe;
Nor let thy noble spirit grieve,
Its life of glorious fame to leave
On earth below.' 

- Jorge Manrique, from <i>Coplas a la Muerte de su Padre</i>, translation by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
