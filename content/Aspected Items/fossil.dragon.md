# Dragon Fossil
When the Carapace Cross passed into History, some rendered themselves to earth, to become as their gods once were. This specimen of the Wyrmefota slumbered in Mount Scopas, guarded by a hermetic contingent of the Colonel's Histids. It was prized as a trophy to their master's triumphs, but they warned of leaving it in darkness, 'for what dies beneath the Sun may be born again in Night.'
