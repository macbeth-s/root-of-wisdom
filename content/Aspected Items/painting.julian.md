# Julian Coseley'
Julian is known to be Winter-long: at a prescribed date, his Hour-patron will ensure him a beautiful ending, but until then, he is even harder than most Long to dispose of finally.

Initial Location: Worm Exhibit
## Consider
Coseley is known worldwide as a 'Worm of Worms,' courtesy of his former colleague, the mystic and antiquarian Claude Hersault. Father Diego Orgóñez exchanged letters with Coseley for a brief period in the seventeenth century, but his connection to the Haustorium has remained tenuous at best. How did this arrive here?
