# 'Chained in Gold'
A mannerist portrait of Leonor's father, a leader before the Conquest.
Initial Location: [[curicuillorianroom|Curicuillorian Room]]
## Consider
The presentation of this painting to the rattled Curicuillorians, four years after Leonor's death, did much to ease the truce between Bahamonde and the Curicuillorians
