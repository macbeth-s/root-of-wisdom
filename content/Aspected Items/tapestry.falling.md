# When One Falls, Another Rises'
Two figures reach out towards each other: a woman descends from above wrapped in webs; a man comes from below clad in feathers. Threads and roots cling to their limbs, countless figures entangled in the weave.
Initial Location: Spidery Ascent
## Consider
The woman is unmistakably Leonor Curicuillor, but the man does not resemble any of the Haustorium's guests. None of its <i>known</i> guests, in any case. Along the upper borders, spindly fingers pull at the threads, and clinging to one is a figure clad in the robes of the Company Anchorite.
<br>**Effect:** Hindsight
