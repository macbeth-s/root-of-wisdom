# Pendulum Clock
Inscribed upon the iron weight is the closed eye of the Obliviates. The hour hand is a feather, the minute hand ribboned and twisted.
<br>Initial Location: [[councilroom|Council Room]]
## Consider
The Iron Chain prohibits the Obliviates from revealing themselves to the world, but the Haustorium is not quite a part of the world - not entirely.
