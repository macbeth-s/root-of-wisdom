A lumpy mass of multicolored fungi takes up the entirety of the background. Engulfed in its growths are swords, birds, needles, rosaries. Standing before it is a shadowed figure bowing away from the viewer. Soft protrusions branch from the head.
Initial Location: Spidery Ascent
## Consider
When Robigo first came to the Haustorium, she wished to meet the many souls who came here.

Nowdays, he prefers to find hosts across the wider world, and has of late found a number of favorites.
**Effect:** Regret
