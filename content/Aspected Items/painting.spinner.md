# 'Attendant to Fate'
Delivered to the Haustorium a scant few years ago from an anonymous sender, identified only as a 'cousin to Teodoro.'

Initial Location: [[grandentrance]]
## Consider
In 1755, Teodoro Cisneros y Peralta arrived to the Haustorium. A century later, Francisco Laso returned to Peru. It's likely only a coincidence... but both could be considered a homecoming.
