# Arm of the Colonel: Biedde, Scourge of Ways
An avaricious arm of the Colonel: Biedde, Scourge of Ways, who wields every blade, whose course is unchanging. Biedde carries out his duties with fervor instead of cold pragmatism, rare for a Name of the Colonel. Perhaps he bears passions from the days of the low red sun, when the Colonel was an Hour-to-be; when his trophies were not scars, but the scaled shells of his gold-blooded quarries.
Initial Location: Scarred Chancel
