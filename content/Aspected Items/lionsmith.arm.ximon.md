# Arm of the Lionsmith: Ximon, Fuel and Flame
A capricious arm of the Lionsmith: Ximon, Fuel and Flame, who burns and is burnt in turn. Ximon dies to spark outrage and returns to lead the resulting turmoil. One account claims he is not one, but many; that when killed, a new iteration emerges from his most ardent follower. The Lionsmith did not come from the Carapace Cross, but his unyielding emnity towards the slayer of the Seven-Coiled would certainly draw their allegiance.
