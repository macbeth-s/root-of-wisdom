# Seasons
## Dry Season
The Horned-Axe's season.
## Wet Season
Once, the Tide's season. Now, the Malachite's.
## Camai Quilla
A time of festivals, of plenty, of rest, of appeasing the gods.
# Time
## Daybreak
Another night wasn't endless.
## Dawn
At this time the friars of the Colegio would ensure the Cloistered were covered in black cloth, so that the Madrugad's light might not reach them.
## Morning
The third hour, when light first makes its journey through the Andes. Watch as the day opens like a door.
## Noon
Before the great division, this was the Sixth Hour, when the friars ruefully permitted rites to honor the Sun-in-Splendour. Now Noon, as they say, is not as it was.
## Afternoon
When the doors of the Mansus are most tightly closed. Time for a siesta without fear of unwelcome dreams. 
## Dusk
Night from day; silver from gold. The vesper-hour when the friars would mark the rising of the evening-star Meniscate.
## Night
Night has fallen. Dawn will come soon. Keep vigil.
